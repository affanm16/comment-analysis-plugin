I know is subjective if I ask you about flutter being a good choice in 2024 and for the future, but I'm kinda scared because I'm currently studying 4th semester of Software Engineering in Colombia and based on what I've learned I'm so confused. I love the front end and like making good looking UIs and great UX, but I'm a little too much scared about if it's worth it to learn Flutter for being a mobile dev in a future, or maybe based on your opinion: Which technology/roadmap would you recommend me (doesn't have to be mobile). I wouldn't have so much trouble with changing into another thing, but being brutaly honest, would you recommend flutter for an entry level dev?

I love it and to resume what i said, if you can't use all these languages you're not a real programmer, i will definitely learn kotlin in the future and react native❤ ❤","0","@ridabrahim7604","false","false","false","false","","false",""

I want to learn only one such easy language in depth, by dint of which I can perform Data Automation (Because everyday I've to deal with a huge amount of Data manually.) as well as Android Development and iOS Development. 001) Can Python serve both of my purposes? 002) Can I run Python on Android Studio to develop any kind of apps or games for Android and see the Live Preview of how it looks like on Android Phone when it will be installed? 003) Do I need to learn another language like Java or Kotlin - or Python will more than enough for this job?  I'm emphasizing on Python because of its simplicity. My dream was to become a Mobile App Developer. But, after my father demise, I couldn't find much time to learn mobile development and came to the Data Field. Once I learn them completely, I'll start freelancing for some of my known clients.   I'm an absolute beginner. That's why I'm a little concerned about this. Please guide me. 004) Will I be able to freelance as a Mobile App Developer using Python on Upwork or Fiverr like Sites?","0","@kartickchakraborty9135","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"2 months ago (edited)","For those who are unsure which option to select, just go with the one that seems the simplest and stick with it. When you run into trouble, keep trying—don't give up or switch. Consider the issue from several perspectives, and if you find yourself struggling with a problem for hours, take a break and come back to it.   Let me jot down some of the things about Flutter and React native.  Flutter: 1. It has an easier learning curve as compared to react native. 2. Has a tone of features built in the framework and the free packages available make it easy to integrate almost anything 3. The market of Flutter is mostly in Middle East and Africa (and somewhat in South Asia as well). 4. Its not just limited to mobile dev, mac os, linux, windows, smart watch etc its a truly cross platform.  React native: 1. Its easier if you already know web development. 2. You can implement almost anything the same way you can do on web. 3. Its market is mostly in USA and Europe. 4. You'll find a lot of libraries and sdks and good documentation for React native which is a big plus compared to Flutter.  PROBLEMS: Flutter: 1. When you start learning you'd feel like importing packages for almost everything which does sound cool and easy, but results in a massive sized app and makes you lazy (so my advice, try and implement it yourself first if you can't then try and read the code of the package you're about to implement).  2. Since Google has a bad reputation for not properly supporting its technologies, developers are currently facing another dilemma as a result of supporting two cross-platforms at once (Flutter and KMP). This will lead to strange competition and eventually the discontinuation of one of these.   The reason for this, a lot of native devs prefer KMP because of Kotlin and people who don't feel comfortable with Kotlin / Java go for Flutter (Dart).  3. There's a big gap in available packages for Flutter compared to React Native and Android/IOS,  For example, if you're strictly a Flutter dev and you dont know native android and ios, then you'll definitely be at the mercy of Google, they're not providing or pushing companies to create their SDKs for Flutter (they do have the power but for some reason they are reluctant).  React native: 1. Its performance has not been improved as Flutter has, it could be better. 2. Debugging is difficult and you'll feel your app has micro jitters or stutters sometimes when you create a big app. 3. React Native lacks some basic features that are easily available in native android and ios, so you will be implementing them customly.  <=> Its all my opinion so it may or may not be wrong and if I offended somebody I apologise in advance.
