Make sure its in a role you actually like and not doing it for the sake of it.   I started as front end dev, then automated testing for 2yrs, carried out some devops work (bringing about continuous delivery,  setting up standards and procedures for making better software, forcing devs to test properly before handing off new updates) and found myself in devops role. Devops mean different thing to different organisation, it's less about knowing technologies and more about doing shit to improve business processes and deliver high quality software quickly.","6","@StevieWondersEyes","true","false","false","false","","false",""

There is no entry level jobs for DevOps, any ads that say so often are just aysadmin roles or a business attempting to severely underpay for a devops engineer. If you're bad at coding and are going through swe route, then get better at it via experience. Also there's much more to an swe role than coding.  Pick any role in tech, get good at that role, get wide range of experience and then transition to DevOps.
