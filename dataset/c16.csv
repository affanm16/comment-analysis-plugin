As someone who deeply appreciates the work you do in raising awareness on important social and global issues, I am reaching out to you with a humble request.  The Rohingya people have endured decades of statelessness, discrimination, and violence, leading to a humanitarian crisis that remains largely underreported and misunderstood. Despite the dire situation, our voices often go unheard, and our stories remain untold on the global stage.  I believe that your platform has the power to shed light on our plight and bring attention to the injustices faced by my community. By addressing the Rohingya crisis on your channel, you could play a crucial role in educating your international audience about the ongoing struggles we face and the urgent need for global intervention.  Your ability to articulate complex issues in a clear and compelling manner makes you an ideal advocate to help amplify our voices. It is my sincere hope that you would consider dedicating an episode or segment to the Rohingya crisis, helping to bring our story to those who might otherwise never hear it.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. Your support could make a significant difference in our fight for justice, peace, and recognition. I pray that God blesses you abundantly for your efforts in spreading truth and awareness.  We Rohingya online users love to watch you because your explanation is very clear.

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","5","@sujeetkumar7742","false","false","false","false","","false",""

This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2.

Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","4","@nishakumarisahu6035","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","3","@sumitmali4383","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","2","@AnujYadav-mc8nh","false","false","false","false","","false",""

On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","2","@manojkammar-h2g","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","1","@juliasbiswas0001","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","1","@shitanshuranjansrivastava2983","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","We want justice  We want job  It’s a biggest job scam by Infosys pvt ltd   Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","0","@TheAnmolvlogs-ih8ds","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,   I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.   I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.   Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.   To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.   I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.   I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.   Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.    Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.   Thanks and Regards,  Dipti Patil","0","@Happiness_138","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Hi sir, hope you are well, I am a Bangladeshi citizen, I want your original opinion on the below mentioned topic, and an unbiased video on this topic.  Every year during the dry season, the Indian government shuts off the rivers flowing between Bangladesh and India, which dries up Bangladesh's rivers, affecting Bangladesh's agricultural industry and reducing crop production.    On the other hand, when the rivers of Bangladesh are full of water during the monsoon, India pushes the stored water towards Bangladesh during the dry season, thereby affecting the people of Bangladesh.    Many people die, India takes maximum advantage of all aspects of such losses in Bangladesh, as the agricultural industry of Bangladesh is weakened due to lack of water during the dry season, resulting in reduced crop production, due to scarcity.   To produce crops according to demand, food has to be imported into the country, followed by potatoes.    Bangladesh surrendered to India for various food items including onion, garlic, rice dal, then when Bangladesh did not need water, India drowned Bangladesh by releasing water to Bangladesh.      This is how India has been extracting maximum benefits from Bangladesh by withholding water during the dry season for ages.","0","@user-gz8yy7ip4s","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Dear Dhruv Rathi team,  I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an ongoing issue I have been facing with the onboarding process at Infosys, which has become increasingly frustrating and disheartening.  I was selected for the System Engineer role at Infosys Limited in 2022. Along with me, more than 2,000 other students were selected for SE and DSE roles during 2022-23. Many candidates, including myself, rejected offers from other companies to work at Infosys. Unfortunately, after our selection, the joining process has been continuously delayed for nearly two years.  Earlier this year, after the prolonged delay, we were asked to participate in an unpaid virtual pre-training program from July 1, 2024, to July 24, 2024. On the first day of training, the HR team (Sudhir Mishra and Komal Papdeja) assured us that an assessment would be conducted on July 24, and based on the results, our joining would be finalized by August 19 or September 2. Despite these assurances, I did not receive any communication regarding my results, even after waiting for more than 20 days.  To my surprise, I was later informed that I needed to retake the pre-training exam offline. This unexpected development has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about the reliability of this process. Having invested over two years in anticipation of joining, only to be repeatedly delayed and subjected to further assessments, I am deeply concerned about the transparency and professionalism of the onboarding process.  I trusted that the onboarding process, initially promised to be conducted at the Mysore campus, would be handled with the utmost professionalism. Yet, despite fulfilling all requirements and expectations on my end, it feels as though my time and efforts have been disregarded.  I am now reaching out for clarity, justice, and a resolution to ensure that this situation does not continue to negatively impact me or others in a similar position. My hope is that Infosys will recognize the significant impact this delay has had on me and take the necessary steps to address it promptly.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this issue.   Some other big mnc's are also doing these delay things with candidates from last two years.","0","@Sri-d5i","false","false","false","false","","false",""

"1 month ago","Make video on reservation Creamy layer subcategorization   Reservation was never just about FINANCIAL STATUS; it's about addressing deep-rooted SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION.  Some believe that DISCRIMINATION only happens in rural areas, but this isn't true. I've personally experienced it in URBAN SETTINGS, where people MOCK LOWER-CASTE individuals and use DEROGATORY LANGUAGE. I've seen classmates RIDICULE students simply because they were SC, ST or PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED.  Ironically, these same people call for an end to RESERVATIONS, ignoring the very discrimination that JUSTIFIES them. They argue that CASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION is a thing of the past, yet their actions-like OPPOSING INTERCASTE MARRIAGES- suggest otherwise. EDUCATED FAMILIES still REJECT marriage proposals based solely on CASTE, proving that these PREJUDICES persist.  Some say RESERVATIONS should be based on ECONOMIC STATUS alone, but this overlooks the CENTURIES of SOCIAL INJUSTICE faced by MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES.  Discrimination isn't just about MONEY; it's about DIGNITY, RESPECT, and EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. Discrimination also manifests in SUBTLE WAYS-like being OVERLOOKED FOR PROMOTIONS or facing MICROAGGRESSIONS daily. These experiences are often DISMISSED by those who've never faced them.  So, why do some want both:  Το DISCRIMINATE and TO END RESERVATION?  If they truly believe discrimination is over, they should start by addressing their own BIASES. Until then, RESERVATIONS remain not just VALID but ESSENTIAL.","0","@sukuna5182","false","false","false","false","","false",""

After joining the department unmarried, many of them have now settled into married life. However, the absence of a transfer policy within the UP NHM has left them stranded in districts far from their sasural, causing significant personal and family distress.These women are not just facing isolation in unfamiliar cities with inadequate salaries, but are also vulnerable to exploitation and harassment by NHM officers. The lack of support and a clear transfer policy is taking a severe toll on their mental and emotional well-being, leading to extreme cases where some have tragically taken their own lives.This is a serious issue that demands immediate attention. I urge you to use your platform to bring this to light and advocate for these women, who are in desperate need of a fair and humane transfer policy. They need your voice to ensure their safety and dignity.Thank you for considering this crucial issue.","0","@SANTRAM-rw5ur","false","false","false","false","","false",""

She must have forgotten that they also did the same thing to her when she played internationals. Every time she lost in international tournaments they used to give blow ups of her shattered images in leading national news papers. They didn't flash her victories till she reached semi-finals. They are praising her now because vinesh has become a political challenge for them since your own community has shown full backing to her against conspiracy committed on her by rivals communities at Paris Olympics.        Saina has forgotten when she was on peak of her career a movie was proposed to be made on her with then top actress Sharadha kapoor but these very rivals of her community had forced the producer and actress to back off from the venture and the proposed movie was put in deep cold storage. It was only when her fame faded a movie was allowed to be made with a mid level heroine.
