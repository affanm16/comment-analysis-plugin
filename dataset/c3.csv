"3 weeks ago","Hi Mosh Sir, I wanted to share a perspective regarding the Hindi-speaking audience in India. While Hindi is widely spoken, our everyday language often includes a blend of Hindi, English, Sanskrit, and Urdu. As a result, using purely formal Hindi can sometimes be difficult for people to fully comprehend. However, as developers, we are all quite comfortable with English, and the English you use in your tutorials is clear and easy to follow. Therefore, it might not be necessary to invest your valuable time and effort in creating Hindi dubs, as the current format works well for us.   We love your tutorial are we learn losts.
