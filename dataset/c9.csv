It's not impossible, but very small percentage of folk will be able to do it, 6 months is really not much. And even if, those 6 months will get you the absolute basics. Don't give yourself any static deadlines with something as complex as AI/ML. Rather, make a milestone calendar and get advice from someone experianced. Believe me it helps a lot. Assess your progress in intervals, and grind and apply your knowledge iteratively, meaning increase the size and the complexity of your projects in small steps.","4","@turmoilstabilizer9054","true","false","false","false","","false",""
