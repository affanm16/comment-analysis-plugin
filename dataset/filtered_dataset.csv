" @Gaurav76831  Why Hindi? programing languages are in English for understanding Tamil is enough! Don't impose Hindi! If possible to get a job in Bangalore, Hyderabad or Chennai or Coimbatore learn South Indian languages or we will impose it on you!"
No​ @Gaurav76831 
​ @HeyMr.OO7 Hindi is not worthy language. Always legendary and oldest original prime language தமிழ் . So we expect tamil version only 😐. Hindi worst ever seen. Boycott vadakkans.   Note: I'm not against to North Indians. I hate specifically who's trying to spread hindi and says that Hindi is national language. I remaind you there is no national language for India.
​ @SandeepPrajapati-cg8vx yeah probably
​ @Gaurav76831 😂 kadharals. Boycott hindi

Yes
" @shubhamagarwal16   const also pakArmy = ""Terrorist'sArmy"""
Most people in pakistan can understand hindi
 @mayanksolanki3483  All people can understand Hindi. Hindi and Urdu are same but some words make confused.
"Hindi is like raw material, urdu is finished product. Choice is yours .😂"
Lol! You can not learn in urdu. At least hindi and urdu are same approach 80 percent.
" @Anuj_pal_1  I agree with you, bro. But not 80 percent. It's 95 percent."
​ @shubhamagarwal16  i also hate our army but tea was fantastic 😅😅
Does Islam allow science & tech? 😮😮
" @bmyadav4633  Of course, as your religion allows drinking cow urine."
Yeah

So you once try his videos in hindi or english. Choice is yours.
I'd like to suggest Kannada language for Kannada audience. I'm from Bengaluru which is in Karnataka & it is in India. Please dub in Kannada also. Thank you :)
with Kannada it might cover 5% of the audience.   with Hindi he'll reach much larger Indian population 🇮🇳🇮🇳 take no offense pls
" @HeyMr.OO7  What ever it might be but, I'd definitely recommend these videos to be dubbed in Kannada also not just only in Hindi. Because we don't know Hindi. We only know Kannada & English."
 @fullStackInKannada   yeahh ..  whatever

"Honestly its useless mosh. Your english is pretty understandable.  My mother tongue is tamil, but i cant understand the tamil version of your last video [python projects] 😂😅. Because its pure tamil. No one is talking pure tamil i guess.  And the other thing is, your motive is to teach us to get hired, but the fact is, most of the interview is in english. In my early days when i am not good at english, I still watched your videos eventually i get good at in english as well. Thats in my opinion is most important skill to get hired in high paying jobs.  So, there is no use in learn in our own language. So in my opinion its useless. Please don't get me wrong.  Note for nerds, try to learn in english even though you don't know english. Definitely you will improve that eventually. Thats what i did in my early days."
Urdu is so much Needed. Mosh please make sure add Urdu. ❤

Everything appears large and as if you are recording a low resolution, which is why everything appears huge.

Plz don't use original Hindi language for dubbing use hinglish language that is mixture of Hindi and English ❤❤❤
why
It’s not just for u
 @skullerhood  because hinglish is easy to understand and don't have deficult words
You don't understand Hindi completely?
LMAOOOOO HINGLISH💀 just pick one
 @nocopyrightgameplaystockvi231  I know Hindi but I don't understand such difficult words that are from pure Hindi
Yes
"Agree with Hinglish   ,as i don't want to listen to this tutorial in Hindi, English is pretty good."
Isn't that AI
Naam nirsidht karte h💀  Naam assign karte h 🎉
 @Engr3820  only very few words are pure Hindi
 @UseVinodKr  looks like it
 @AC0_0  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Bhai me bhi Hindi se hu, but technical skills English me simple hoti hai."
" @Engr3820  utna kuch words nahi hai bhai,,, these are just uncommon words not heard. But inko samaj loge toh coding mein bhaari matra mein nuksaan nai hoga 😂"
Seems it's Hinglish only for the AI
Agree with it
​ @HarmanSingh_315 listen in english then. I mean hate for hindi in a programming channel as well🤦🏻🤦🏻
 @imvdhruv  bhai hindi sa koi hate nahi  Pure hindi ma padha ma ha Or basa bi Mosh  AI scripting ka use kar raha ha
" @imvdhruv   Additionally, based on my prior experiences, I believe that learning programming in English makes it simple to explain to others."
Mosh you have the perfect voice to explaining Python.

"Hey Mosh,  I hope you're doing well! I'm interested in becoming a Python backend developer and would love your advice on how to get started. Could you please provide some guidance on the steps I should take and the resources I should use to learn effectively?  Thank you so much for your help!  Best regards, Abbad"
"Hi Mosh Sir, I wanted to share a perspective regarding the Hindi-speaking audience in India. While Hindi is widely spoken, our everyday language often includes a blend of Hindi, English, Sanskrit, and Urdu. As a result, using purely formal Hindi can sometimes be difficult for people to fully comprehend. However, as developers, we are all quite comfortable with English, and the English you use in your tutorials is clear and easy to follow. Therefore, it might not be necessary to invest your valuable time and effort in creating Hindi dubs, as the current format works well for us.   We love your tutorial are we learn losts. Thank you 😊❤"
Mosh you are my best online teacher
Thanks for using hindi ❤❤❤
Please do Your website in django and SQL courses for Hindi language available please 🥺 before 15 sep
I do the same thing with comments before I write code. I layout what I am doing before I write the code to do it. And this actually helps a LOT.
thanks mosh put the course on sale for longer period of time ❤
Thank you Mosh sir from Tamil Nadu
Hello Mosh. For how long do I have access to your course after purchase? Thanks for the discount too.

As per i know programming is not required for game development
 @navalprakash3727  yes it is as it requires you to have knowledge about c++ (mostly). Companies won’t hire just for game engines. They will hire you for game engine knowledge and programming knowledge
" @navalprakash3727  i'm also looking for one, tryna get into the mobile game dev scene. Do you have a discord maybe? so i can reach out? Need to have connections with like minds, if you don't mind"

​ @navalprakash3727 its requied bro even more than programing web and mobile aps
" @navalprakash3727  you know wrong , ofc programming is used for game dev , its one of the most fundamental thing for game dev , especially languages like C#"
Mosh is the must subscribe YouTube channel and it does not matter on what level of your programming journey you are. His way of structuring content and teaching is exceptional. I am learning a lot from him as an instructor myself. Thank you Mosh.

Please make a full Flutter tutorial 🙏🙏🙏
Please send a real time spring boot project in your upcoming spring boot course.😊
"Hey Mosh. I want to thank you for making this video due to I've been thinking seriously about being a mobile dev. I know is subjective if I ask you about flutter being a good choice in 2024 and for the future, but I'm kinda scared because I'm currently studying 4th semester of Software Engineering in Colombia and based on what I've learned I'm so confused. I love the front end and like making good looking UIs and great UX, but I'm a little too much scared about if it's worth it to learn Flutter for being a mobile dev in a future, or maybe based on your opinion: Which technology/roadmap would you recommend me (doesn't have to be mobile). I wouldn't have so much trouble with changing into another thing, but being brutaly honest, would you recommend flutter for an entry level dev? Thank you so much, and sorry for the message lenght :("
"JavaScript everyday, man!"
Great work! love your content. Keep it up!
"Thank you very much, Mosh. About a year ago, I was deeply into programming and almost on the verge of giving up. Then, one day, I opened my phone, went to YouTube, and searched for Python courses. I came across your videos, watched them, and started practicing. I never stopped and kept pushing forward. After that, I watched your web development course and took your Java course.  Now, I'm a certified full-stack developer working for one of the biggest companies in the world. The most remarkable part of the story is that I'm not even 17 yet. This experience has shown me that everything is possible.   I just want to say a very big thank you. You and your inspirational videos have been life-changing for me. Please keep going and never stop.  😊😊😊"
"Wow, that’s a great, inspirational story! I’m glad I’ve been part of your journey. Thanks for sharing your story and inspiring all of us. Keep up the great work:"

interested to le7arn this kind of niche but so difficult to achieve hop7e i can be like you p7o
Could you do a full-stack roadmap please!
I have roadmaps on both front end and back end. Start with the backend and then move to the front end. You don’t need a separate roadmap for that.
hey mosh does jetbrains Rider offer same power as visual studio
Some people say Netflix uses Reactjs and now you say they used kotlin developing it …
I think you're new in this industry
 @rockdon243  how so ?
Loving 🥰 it Mosh! Great! Information!
"Hey Mosh ,  we want full stack Developer ROAD MAP  as soon as Possible thanks"
I have roadmaps on both front end and back end. Start with the backend and then move to the front end. You don’t need a separate roadmap for that.
How ionic fits in this ecosystem ?
Please make videos on .NET 8 and later.
I'll try!
Amazing roadmap ❤❤

Do you have plans to update the react native course ?
Not at this stage because it can’t be patched. It needs a full revamp. I’m considering to do that next year.
i hope you make a flutter course soon
Thanks Mosh! Happy 4th July! Would appreciate a video about REFLEX Python one day. Thanks agan.
Mosh Bro can you deliver a roadmap on devops Engineering
How about ionic with angular?
I second you mosh transition from react to react native is super ease
all access 29 dollar ? which mean i can learn any course from available courses from your website ?
"That’s the monthly payment that gives you access to all the courses, yes!"
"cliffs: to get a job in 2024, learn them ALL."
Will i not start growing grey hairs before i complete all this learning 😒 Mr Mosh ended it with to apply for an entry level mobile developer job 😒😕🤦
"Mosh,you are the best, if you don't mind   can you make a video on how you become software engineer, your experience will help us in our journey"
"I’m not sure what you’re asking. I already have roadmaps to become a front-end, back-end or mobile developer on this channel. Please explain more and I’ll do my best to help you out."
​ @programmingwithmosh   Sorry for my language and I have seen those videos but it would be a great lesson if you tell us how you became a software engineer. Learning coding is hard and if we know how our role model learned it will be a great inspiration for us.  Thank you
would love to see a flutter course from you
Wait you are a mobile dev???
Ya 12 months so long I want within 1 day😂
That was a so beautiful and structured guideline. Thanks Mosh!
"I've been waiting for Flutter with concepts not Implementation especially state management solutions like Bloc and behind the scenes , I'm a big fan of you 😍 Mosh ( thanks)"
"Sir, does it make sense to learn in 12 months and work with a good salary? If it were, everyone would do it. Honestly, I don’t like shortcuts. I want a long road map to build a solid foundation and then specialize. Thank you."
Cybersecurity Roadmap  PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE
"Thank you, Mosh. ❤"

Solodity developer roadmap please
Mosh we need to see your face please. Make a face video :)
"A flutter course should be great, specially if you show to people that dart is really close to typescript. And I feel like the dev experience, the performances and the UI possibilities are better on flutter than RN."
Thanks mosh
"I use Dart and Flutter for my own self and i love it, Dart is a language that will just make you a better programmer because of the similarities with the best languages available like in example java and c++, object oriented language which allowed me to open my eyes and expand my knowledge, also it's very hard to write buggy code because you can literally define types for Maps, lists and even the components. I love it and to resume what i said, if you can't use all these languages you're not a real programmer, i will definitely learn kotlin in the future and react native❤ ❤"
Where your .net core backend or full stack course with a deep insight

"I am Currently learning Native development using java. I spirit just gone after seeing the video, that cross platform is on trending and native is rule out. Isn't there any strong site or strong job chances for native developers?"
"I have this question, Web Developers have this option of fullstack (MEAN/MERN). Is there anything like that for Mobile Developers (Fullstack Mobile Developer)."
"Finally Mosh Read comments, great Guru!"
Next Game development. And ai development

"please do Flutter, Mosh."
I'm not familiar with Dart but I'd take C# or Kotlin over JavaScript any day
"Hi, mosh. I really do wanna know how to play with javascript. I'm focusing on web development, and I've been trying to write codes in javascript, but it's still not easy for me.

"Hey Mosh, do you have any plans to make a physical book for your courses? When I'm studying the courses, I sometimes encounter parts that I don't understand and want to review, but I don't have notes. So, I have to go back to the previous lessons and take notes again, which slows down my learning progress. Or is there a better solution for this?"

I want to learn only one such easy language in depth, by dint of which I can perform Data Automation (Because everyday I've to deal with a huge amount of Data manually.) as well as Android Development and iOS Development. 001) Can Python serve both of my purposes? 002) Can I run Python on Android Studio to develop any kind of apps or games for Android and see the Live Preview of how it looks like on Android Phone when it will be installed? 003) Do I need to learn another language like Java or Kotlin - or Python will more than enough for this job?  I'm emphasizing on Python because of its simplicity. My dream was to become a Mobile App Developer. But, after my father demise, I couldn't find much time to learn mobile development and came to the Data Field. Once I learn them completely, I'll start freelancing for some of my known clients.   I'm an absolute beginner. That's why I'm a little concerned about this.

"For those who are unsure which option to select, just go with the one that seems the simplest and stick with it. When you run into trouble, keep trying—don't give up or switch. Consider the issue from several perspectives, and if you find yourself struggling with a problem for hours, take a break and come back to it.   Let me jot down some of the things about Flutter and React native.  Flutter: 1. It has an easier learning curve as compared to react native. 2. Has a tone of features built in the framework and the free packages available make it easy to integrate almost anything 3. The market of Flutter is mostly in Middle East and Africa (and somewhat in South Asia as well). 4. Its not just limited to mobile dev, mac os, linux, windows, smart watch etc its a truly cross platform.  React native: 1. Its easier if you already know web development. 2. You can implement almost anything the same way you can do on web. 3. Its market is mostly in USA and Europe. 4. You'll find a lot of libraries and sdks and good documentation for React native which is a big plus compared to Flutter.  PROBLEMS: Flutter: 1. When you start learning you'd feel like importing packages for almost everything which does sound cool and easy, but results in a massive sized app and makes you lazy (so my advice, try and implement it yourself first if you can't then try and read the code of the package you're about to implement).  2. Since Google has a bad reputation for not properly supporting its technologies, developers are currently facing another dilemma as a result of supporting two cross-platforms at once (Flutter and KMP). This will lead to strange competition and eventually the discontinuation of one of these.   The reason for this, a lot of native devs prefer KMP because of Kotlin and people who don't feel comfortable with Kotlin / Java go for Flutter (Dart).  3. There's a big gap in available packages for Flutter compared to React Native and Android/IOS,  For example, if you're strictly a Flutter dev and you dont know native android and ios, then you'll definitely be at the mercy of Google, they're not providing or pushing companies to create their SDKs for Flutter (they do have the power but for some reason they are reluctant).  React native: 1. Its performance has not been improved as Flutter has, it could be better. 2. Debugging is difficult and you'll feel your app has micro jitters or stutters sometimes when you create a big app. 3. React Native lacks some basic features that are easily available in native android and ios, so you will be implementing them customly.  <=> Its all my opinion so it may or may not be wrong and if I offended somebody I apologise in advance. Edits and suggestions will be appreciated <=>"

Need flutter tutorials for beginners.
Thank you so much Sir Mosh😊 for complete roadmap
I simply request sir can you provide complete informative road map about AI and Data analytics like these road maps which helped me lot
Thanks sir it's help me lot and also spared my value able time after this complete road map
Vue Native ?!!!
Is kotlin and kmp is good options for current market??
Who is John Smith?
so...no kotlin?
Kitne ka korse hai
"I recommend this channel. This roadmap is very clear and concise. Parabéns muito, Mosh! See you at the top"
"Please put video on ""The Complete Game Development roadmap"""
Sir is c++ compostable for cross platform in app development
"Following your advice, only with 5 essential skills can I become a good Mobile app developer?"
Hi Mosh. I have just finished Python courses and can I continue with kivy for being a mobile app developer? Or should start learning from JavaScript and then continue with Flutter?
but i just completed learning kotlin 2 weeks ago
Hi
thank you so much for sharing this.
What about backend for those mobile apps?
"Can you suggest some free and paid resources to learn flutter and dart, please?"
Is it worth to learn React native now?
I am a doctor. Apart from my career I want to learn this app development . What should I start first. Because before my college days I love to learn small computer courses . Can you guide me sir
start learning dart and get into flutter would be the easiest way
I like kotlin multi-platform
oh yeah yet another fucking language no fucking way
Bro forgot about ionic
As a next video to this could you please tell the steps involved in mobile App developed in Native and Cross platform categories.Thank you for the clear description.
"Dear Mosh could you please enable an option in your website for the cryptocurrency payment method as like BTC,ETH and USDT ?"
Any chance for a flutter fullstack course?
Like the editing style 👍
Love your content Mosh
good but teach us the machine learning not the clues to learn machine learning I hope you will teach us (you are the best software Engineering of all time. )
is kotlin good for app development and also need a course in kotlin for app development
Is kotlin a good choice?
"Hello, please I'm confused I want to build a mobile app but others are telling me to start with web development first and I was wondering if anyone can help me cause I don't know what to do and where to start 😓💔"
Same here bro
Thank you for the video
What is the backend of mobileapp????
good one
"Please Add ""Telugu"" Language also"
So I’m trying to build a mobile app however I don’t have the time and resources to learn code myself. How can I find a great team to help me build said app and how can I conduct interviews to know they’re great? Thanks!
благодаря тебе начал пользоваться Байбитом)
did anyone buy any of his courses and can recommend them?
Test
Very very good and informative video. Straight to the point and with the most important information ❤
"Thats why every time i am looking for a tutorial of sth i add ""mosh"" in the end of my serach ❤❤❤❤❤"
Dart is really the best language i've dealt with in terms of syntax and ease of development
Good
"You will also need to learn a backend (Firebasre, Node.js, Phython etc) to make a more meaningful app. Just learning the above aren't enough unfortunately."
Nice video especially who are wandering in the technological world
How i should learn data structure and algorithm as a beginner?
http://www.youtube.com/@Sjkoreanacademy
what about .net MAUI ? you never mentioned APP/Cross platform development using MAUI & may be JAVA
can i use this application to develop my live tracking gps project
Hi your this video really helps me to better understand my roadmap else I would lose into an unreached path.
Do you teach data & algorithm??
I wan’t to know how to make a tutorial video like you? Do you any instruction?
greatest videos
Hindi ?
Hello sir I'm new to tech thank you for this knowledge but if you want to be a mobile app developer is it necessary to learn web development?
How to develop app by  skechware with audio and its file
you didnt say KIVY

"HEy, Thank you for a wonderful video. A quick question what do you think about the future job opportunities in Flutter?"
Anderson Thomas Rodriguez William Taylor Margaret
"Kindly drop me a note on how long it takes to master Flutterflow, dart and flutter and what it take - hours per day and the best YouTube Tutorial"
I like Flutter. it's probably best journey on my tech way. But now im going to learn swift - cause if you want to create some apple watch app or interact with Dynamic Island - you have to create native app or write a Multiplatform parts with native parts anyway.
Make a video with game development
Mosh I have your suscription from 3 years ago and I'm still waitig for Net MAUI course.... would be awesome to learn from you.
He is the number 1 worst youtuber with all coding
I think your answer is best for me.
Mosh I didn't get the course dart link in the road map
Without AWS  nowadays very hard to get job. Please make videos on AWS.
"i believe there are a lot of AWS videos out there, why should Mosh ""invent a bicycle"" ?"
Aws what is stand of
 @evgenii.panaite  Yes!!ur right..but Mosh teaching is different..No fluffy stuff. Topics are concise and clear.
"Industry level AWS is very different than the dummy AWS videos on YouTube. I am working as a professional Nodejs engineer after I finished his Node.js course. AWS has plenty of services. How to make sure things are secure and what services to use when is very important. How to deploy a secure website. Making migration or changes to the RDS service etc. He should make a complete professional AWS videos for specifically Full stack developer, not necessarily to earn certificates."
​ @evgenii.panaite  can you please suggest some playlist for AWS from scratch?
Yes
aws is easy
"That's not true, knowing database and strong problem solving are the keys in backend, however cloud is important but is not that much."
The W3C have videos please check.
Check AWS Skill builder
​ @mahdidarwiish509  Amazon Web Services
" @jannatennayem2596 while it’s nice to have understanding of basics and maybe slightly deeper (like aws architect certification), there are positions called like ‘cloud/devop engineer’ who are supposed to be responsible for such things."
 @evgenii.panaite because he did the same in these videos plus it helps him to get new customers… you so dumb that you got hit by the park car😅😅😅
Wtf are you talking about? 🤣
AWS is fucking irrelevant
AWS is limited...
 @evgenii.panaite lmao reinvent the wheel?
Never heard that it is hard to get a job without AWS Knowledge. I do Not know a single person working with it
"Folks, no hate toward PHP! Just forgot to mention it."
ha ha.. better to do a separate one for PHP for your folks then. 💌 from Sri Lanka!
Sir what about full stalk web development because after learning front end and backend what to do to combine both skills
 @TheVishvaisuranga  😂😂PHP innit!
"@programmingwithmosh I was about to write a comment asking why you ignored PHP. As a PHP developer myself, I felt a bit disappointed, lol. 😅"
really?
 @GaneshSai-iw5wb hey!! Did you any answer for this question. I have same question though …
You forgot to mention a language that is used by almost 50% of all sites on the web...that says something pretty sad about you!
Waiting for PHP course now... 😏
I don't think that's true @programmingwithmosh
that's brutal mosh😂😂
PHP left the chat
😂😂😂😂
No he just forogt to mention it.
I am always intrigued whenever I see Mosh latest video 😄. He'd breakdown everything into understandable units 👌🤓.
"you are obviously a programmer , as quote ""He'd breakdown everything into understandable units"" >> thinking everything must be divided in smaller pieces and units :)"
"My suggested roadmap:  1. Solve 1k-2k problems in C++ or Java then master algorithms and data structures. 2. Master on databases using SQL. 3. Learn C# and build a desktop project or two. 4. Learn API.  Now you're a strong backend developer, next is frontend:  5. Learn HTML, CSS, JS, and choose either React (recommended) or Angular.  After landing an entry-level full stack job, you'll have infinite learning opportunities. Don't worry! 😅"
Save time and headaches and skip C++ unless there is a genuine need for it. I converted a C++ CLI Windows Service to C# and the code base is so very much more tolerable.
"Bro I have a question. I know soringboot, .NET, Django and Express.js very well as a 5 year experience of software engineer. Should I build advanced level project from each framework add my resume ?"
" @mehmetkoyuncuoglu1647   Actually if u know those well u r more expert than me 😅   However In my knowledge I suggest you to focus and build projects in only one framework to be professional on it, switching between technologies is not a big deal don't worry about that."
Hope you should more talk about PHP Laravel.
I agree. Php is still so popular where I live😮
Don't bother. This types of developers/programmers see PhP as a garbage language. They always try to spread hate against it and intentionally leave it out of the ecosystem. Meanwhile they are trying to implement JavaScript in backend to build a full stack pipeline. How funny is that....😂😂😂
"Yep, Mosh has received an unfollow from me. I've been working in PHP for 8 years and make top salary doing it! it literally has 76% market share!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
​ @JustDoit-qt1he  I think this is because they want to sell their courses and products and only care about that. The funniest part is that modern JavaScript has only recently achieved what PHP has been doing for decades.
 @MMH94MMH  I still doubt JS already achieved the milestone. It's true JavaScript came a very long way and is way matured than past. But still there isn't any good framework in JS for full stack development or even a strong backend. Meanwhile Laravel is almost a full stack framework. I m saying almost cause you can't build that good frond end with it. But it's really good and easy for backend.
" @MMH94MMH  In my own opinion, compare to JavaScript, PHP doesn’t look that pretty. That's the main drawback."
PHP is light years behind TypeScript lol
 @marcuss.abildskov7175  Wait...what!!! Have you ever written in both PHP and TypeScript??? 😂😂😂
"​ @marcuss.abildskov7175  TypeScript is literally another way to write JavaScript, and it's all about type declarations and access modifiers, which are not new for PHP bro."
"""Meanwhile they are trying to implement JavaScript in backend to build a full stack pipeline."" 😂"
"or the classic, ""I like using the same language on the frontend as the backend."""
 @fullstacklarry  🤣🤣
why do you always ignore PHP in your videos?
PHP runs over 75% of internet but it's ignored 🤣
You Rock Man!... Perfect as usual. Thanks.

Why bro
"not even mention about php,why?"
php laravel ??

What about php?
"I am stock with Javascript/Typescript for now. Picking Python next. I so much love simplicity.  And thanks to Mosh, your courses are life safer. ❤"
Why you want to go for python Are You got familier with mern Or mean?
Have you missed PHP 8?
Beautiful content ❤️
Boss inamana hujui kama PHP ni popular backend language?
any thoughts about PHP for backend web dev? is it still relevant and in-demand?
No
Nobody uses PHP for new projects anymore
Unless you wanna maintain legacy systems it's not relevant at all
What about php ? Please reply
Excellent sir please send Spring Boot course fast...
"i am not agreed on ""stick on a language"" . i myself have learned a lot of them . though sometimes even for hobby i do this . but there is constants and a lot of similarities in all of them . they all have the same pattern that you will learn no matter which one you take . it is the pattern and thinking you must learn not a bunch of variable and methods ( AI can notwdo that for you )"
"Well ,I don't agree because the beginner learner has to pick one language and learn the basic concept of programming with it ,and once the learner learned the basic concept, at that  moment he /she can easily move to another language."
" @mohammedabdalmajed3914  yes, for the beginner of course . i agree on that"
no php?!
Thanks for the valuable content. What is your thought about PHP as a back-end programming language ♥
"Thanks a lot for this piece, Mosh. What's your advice for someone with 2 years professional experience in frontend development looking to get into backend development?"
"Hi, please make a spring course and aws"
thank you :)
"Mosh, I got to say something:  When you speak, I feel PEACE.  Much obliged for that lad.  I hope I’ll through your online vids and I hope to find a way to reward you.  Cheers"
Thanks for your kind comment! ❤
Expecting a spring boot course for a long time
Sir thank you for this been waiting for more than a week
Thanks 🙏😊
I watched your whole python tutorials but i want to know is that it is the whole python tutorial or just a part of the language.
Thank you for your good programs. continue
Hi Mosh Beautiful Content  Hope You make a video on Full Stack Development also ❤
You have both the front-end and back-end roadmap on my channel. You can start either way. I'd recommend starting with back-end though.
 @programmingwithmosh  Interesting I feel like most people say to start with front-end. Could you explain why you recommend starting with back-end? Could be a video idea too!
 @programmingwithmosh  Thanks for your advice  Mosh
where is the testing?
"I love starting Mosh's videos with a ""Like"" because I know I'm going to enjoy them! His content is always top-notch! 🥰🥰 Looking forward to the next one! 😊"
Thank you sir 😊
hey mosh there is no pdf even i entered my mail 2 times correctly still no pdf came
Please make some videos on Java springboot and AWS
Planning to work on it soon!
​ @programmingwithmosh  Please do the spring boot course ❤. We want to learn spring boot from you!❤
Finally got a reply. Thanks ​ @programmingwithmosh 
Amazing 👏🏻
Where is the link?????
Thank you for valuable information. I have been following you for the past 5 years. But I am eagerly waiting for a course on spring boot. Many industries are using that. If it is possible can you make a course on spring boot. It is going to be very helpful for many people. Finally I wanna thank you for making such great courses. Because of you I'm working on a software company ❤.
"Thank you for your support, my friend! I'm planning to work on Spring Boot. Please be patient and I'll do my best to deliver the best possible course!"
 @programmingwithmosh  thank you very much ❤️
Thank you sir Mosh🤝
Love u sir from India your python 6 hour course is just 🔥🔥
Mosh please make a course on spring boot your website also doesn't show it ❤
Planning to work on it soon.
I love ur endless effort to helping the world
Recommend the Data analyst and Data science roadmap sir.
Where is PHP 😢
"Hi mosh, you just saved my life right now, deciding which language to learn for backend. Thank you for this short and concise guide. I wanna ask, is your site, programming with mosh still active or not? I came to visit there before to read some of your blogs and articles about top 3 programming languages to learn for 2020 but the site is not available. Are you still managing it?"
When for the Spring Boot course ?
How about php laravel
Why Mosh didn't mention PHP? 😳
what about C#?
"Hii Mosh  I am from India 🇮🇳  I watched a lot's of your video  Yours videos content real good  And I also download the front end and back end developer pdf. It's so great content. Thank for that🎉❤ I want to buy your course but it's available in English language,if it's available in Hindi language,I 100% bought it, Once again thank you ❤."
Where is php
please  help me about backend portfilio projects
We want java spring boot course❤
What about PHP Laravel? it's not worth of ignoring!
Thanks for the roadmap. I would like to see another one for full stack
Php doesnt even come into play 😂
please make a course of java spring boot
Thanks a lot mosh 🎉❤
"You know what would be great (if u let me give you a piece of advice) That would a recommendation of where to learn all this bunch of topics, I mean for example if I want to learn SQL I would like to know what resource should I use (without letting out paid ones which use to be the best).  Sorry my spanglis."
There’s no best resource to learn these. We all have our own learning preferences. Find the resources that work for you.
"Hey Sir! Thanks for ur videos ur amazing! I have a question, why you never recomend Books to learn to programing?, I mean you do really learn programing just viewing tutorials and surging the web? Regards!"
"Actually, I personally hardly watch YouTube videos. I read documentations and books. The reason I don’t suggest books is because my audience is not interested in books. I actually posted a poll on this channel. Majority prefer learning by videos and hardly ever read books."
thanks so much sir
mosh can you pls update your React native course pls?
"Cloud computing is a must. Dev ops is a must, at least basic understanding. Please make a course about that"
are you planning to create a course on spring boot ?
When will you be offering the Spring course?
Awesome content. ❤
This is the first time that I clicked on a link provided by a programmer and landed on spam. The mail looks fishy as well.
plz answer me i want crate my personal selling webpage. i want start to learn html and css + javascript thats enaugh crate good looking website? Or i need to learn about other languages or skils
Thanks for this breakdown.
"Pls make roadmap on cybersecurity like  ethical hacking, cybersecurity engineer, pentester, cybersecurity analyst ,etc. I m waiting..."
"Hey Mosh, in your expert opinion as an educator... Which should a self-taught beginner start with, front-end or back-end? Thanks!"
I just needed a proper roadmap in java😅
Plz make videos on ethical hacking career  #programmingwithmosh Plz
Please do a video on DSA roadmap
That doesn't need a roadmap! Get a DSA book or course and study it.
Thank you for your good programs. continue
4th comment?
"This looks awesome. The L1 blockchain, Algorand, now supports native Python and as such I'm interested in learning Python. Do you have any promo codes for your courses?"
Why not FastAPI for python it's emerging and is pretty easy to learn as well. It is also a framework where we can write production ready codes. Not saying Django is bad anyways
The king of programming on YouTube is back 🙌🙌🙌
"1. pl (ecosystem, libraries)  2. version control system(git, git hub) 80/20 80% work done with 20% features 3. Data structure & algorithm(classic cs)  4. Design pattern 5. Database (db engines) 6. Web framework"
hey thanks brother you are the man...
Does anyone know the difference between node js and express js?
"Node js is the runtime environment while express is the framework that lets you build backend applications easily. They’re other framework aside express you can use in node js, nest Js and more"
 @festusfranklin3962  Thanks bud!
"If you want to learn design patterns, there is a book named ""Head First Design Patterns"" You can download it for free l."
thank you ! Can you a make a video in system deseing roadmap?
"Pro tip: i wasted 4 months grinding java before realizing that swing is much more difficult to learn than node or express or even django. Now I'm literally learning nodejs, so please, even if you don't like frontend, JavaScript is really versatile and you'll truly not regret picking it first. #javasucks"
I wish you taught the DSA course in Python instead of Java.
"Crazy, a course on spring boot soon ?"
Working on it!
Please make a course of block chain 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺
I'm learning frontend and I'm thinking of learning backend. I'm bad at choices 😫 I'm also thinking of scrapping frontend knowledge to learn APP DEV cause web dev is ignored nowadays cause of sites like WordPress and many more. I need help
How can i get design pattern in Django?
Roadmap for front end developer please

Next. Js hiw to download how to setup??
could you make a cross platform app development roadmap next? or a CPP roadmap/essential skills or  a diss track on Rustaceans🤣🤣🤣
Coming soon!

ببخشید از کدوم ویدیو باید شروع کنیم به دیدن ؟
Wanted to learn JavaScript and oh boy it's a big programming language 😂
Maybe i should start with python first 😅
I want to get into A.I. I want to make a real Glados. I'm dead serious.
I just come here to listen english😅
It's very sad you don't give data science orientated courses
I didnt get the pdf in my mail. Both the pdf from the frontend and the backend videos
What's your email? Let me know so I can troubleshoot
I am also not get pdf bro
Thank you so much!!!

Amazing video ❤❤❤
Like #808. Good video. I'm study for BackEnd with academy thanks to a scholarship but I think that the road is bad and confused  for me and I don't understand the class. best regards from Panama 🇵🇦
"""Ooof no undo's on this one"""
If i not interested in backend. Want to go with react native and frontend react. Is it good option to take?
I'd say so! That should expand your job horizons.
Thank you❤
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I am not get roadmap pdf
go mentioned!
"These are really good videos, the only problem is, there are no jobs, atleast if you don't have 10 years of experience!"
"start with html css javascript than react or next js than java ,springboot  than along with mongodb and mysql along  with git and github cicd and aws ec2, iam linux cmds bash scripting"
Do you currently live in Toronto?
@mosh the PDF was not delivered on either of my emails. Could you please help?
"Ignore, got it."
Sometimes there's a bit of delay! Glad you got i!
"Very good info. Jesus Christ sacrificed himself for us on the cross. He took the punishment for all of our sins at once. Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
wow even aws this is not gud things getting  disclosed by a person  like  mosh its not gud for rest  of us who  ever quietly  doing  all this
java was a safe side but now they are making  it common  so its not gud
"On point! Only thing I would have changed is Fast API for python. As you said it's good for quick prototyping, and that framework is a good reflection of that. Django is old and frankly, not that good, for robust webapps C# or Java is a lot better with the mentioned Frameworks."
"Thanks Mosh, But i have a small note What about learning the basics of programming in the correct way from my perspective, it is the most important step 😃"
You really got lazy on YT
"MOSH I BEG YOU ,PLEASE DO FLUTTER COURSE❤"
"First of all, I would like to thank you for your engagement with the community. I am an ESL student in a community college. This semester I will complete my classes and fall semester I want to enter the cybersecurity field where should I start? What should be my first course?"
Hello I have been learning restful API but am struggling can u please provide me some advice or tutorial or any help
Very useful
"Perfect roadmap, a major one for me was picking a single language and learning their Libraries soundly. Picking up other languages comes much later after you've master one. The temptation is to pick up several languages. Cause you wanna be ""Polyglot"". However it doesn't work that way. That map is chaotic and disconcerting, especially if your a beginner, upstart. Commit to a single language. The rest of the presentation on point."
Current research there are 42% more people than senior lvl jobs - world wide. Junior lvl is worse..
@mosh sir ur courses are outdated in ur website plz update that
Where is your flutter course?
"People say web dev will die soon , please give your suggestions on this or make a video"
Already covered that in a few videos about AI on this channel.

I  can not download the PDF! please make sure the link is correct.  Thank you. Great tutorial as always.
Mosh prefers Java and C# over JavaScript but wants us to pickup only one programming language😅
Great content! Pdf link not working
Hey Mosh! I have started understanding every topics from ur teachings. A full stack course learnt from you helped me to become a better full stack developer.. And i am very confident when coming to interviews  explaining the topics  on what u taught.. And i recommend my friends to subscribe to codewithmosh who are interested to learn front end or back end technologies.. You are a super guru who can make even rocket science simple..🙏🙏Thank you so much..
"Realistically I doubt 12 months is feasible to be job ready.  Drilling down, I also wonder if it's feasible to jump into Javascript without first knowing HTML and CSS."
Not received the pdf though sent email to share

"Yes, you can"
 @programmingwithmosh  thanks for the reply
Thanks sir which language would you recommend for me who wants to start learning programming?

Also, Golang is designed for web services and so has a lot of features related included in its standard library; therefore, it’s more conventional to use lightweight libs for specific tasks rather than heavy frameworks that mostly just wrappers for what is already in std."
Before learning express.js do I need to study node.js?!
Yes. But Node.js is just an execution environment for JavaScript. There’s not a lot you have to learn. You just need to be proficient in JavaScript.
why need mongo.DB we have Mysql
Two completely different solutions for different problems. You can’t replace one with the other.
Dear Mosh please suggest topics for javascripts.
What do you mean by that?
I forget what I learn after few months. Please suggest how i can retain the information
Please what should I study for Data structures and algorithms?
"Can you help me in this question  Write a C++ program to insert a new node at the beginning of a Singly Linked List with the values 13 11 9 7 5 3 1 . The node value to be inserted is 0. Only test case 1 has passed , rest of the test cases has failed to pass."
"Thank you, Josh, God bless you 🎉"
Is it possible to become a programmer or get into tech if I have a drug charge from over 20 years ago??
What
Hey seniors or fellows! I just got the hang of making CRUD APIs with Node.js and I'm super excited to dive deeper into backend development. What cool and advanced stuff should I look into next? Any tips or resources would be awesome!
why not add your list about php laravel???
For me Go with fiber 👍
Why does PHP language not mention here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYM-7fYmts
Plz make ml engineer roadmap
"You're a real gem 😍 Mosh i like your teaching style,keep on work dude 😎❤"
I am currently learning language c. Should I also need to learn java. Can someone please guide me
When will you have updated C# and Asp. Net course?
"great way to learn is to know 50 % of git and github, Your 80/20 rule makes things difficult to practice for new coders"
4:49 here the course should be Design pattern! Instead it is showing Data Structure and Algorithms!😁
i thought Rust is becoming a really important language i m hesitating between Rust and C# but i cant find any good guide source for Rust
sir pls make roadmap of Ai/ml also
Download don't work
"One thing to consider is what do you ultimately want your role to be. If you want to be a software developer/engineer, then you aren't really deep diving into JavaScript as much as you will want other languages for building desktop applications and services. I still say HTML, CSS, JS with React, Java Spring Boot, and MySQL is the easiest pathway for job security."
Most software engineers work on the web tho
"Excuse me sir, can you please upload video related to RUST programming, the complete tutorials, benefits and drawbacks."
"Hey mosh, tanx 2 ur great info.  If it's possible 4 u, would u plz make a same video for machine learning and artificial intelligence?"
what about Rust??
php
"Hi Mosh!  Hope you are doing well, I am waiting for your AI comprehensive course from basic to advance on youtube can you please make it for us. Your way of teaching is awesome . Hope you make Free AI Course ASAP. waiting for your response."

What about php?
what about python is it suitable for backend?
You are a god sender ❤.. who help us many people to learn everything about programming ❤.lots of love from India in Tamilnadu
does it really possible within 12 months? i doubt about it :)
Thanks Helpful!
there is nothing about Rust !!!! 🤔
"Sorry but companies are not paying $100K+ salaries for something you can learn in a few online courses and certificate of completion. If it was that easy, everyone could do it. No easy way out. Get a degree and don't be fooled by people who just tell you what you want to hear."
where can I learn spring boot?
You shouldn't learn a framework for go
"How I can receive your PDF roadmap, I fill information and e-mail to confirm register, that I check in Gmail but I don't see your attachment you send me."
Excellent! I'm a professional Youtube uploader myself and I'm quite aware how difficult it is to make a single video. Bravo! Keep up the good work.
Mosh Sir can u make a video on  roadmap on DSA java with the pdf
The Link doesn't work 😭
Please create a fastapi course with python
today also is another day
Please if I want to learn programming for designing witch launguage I have ti learn

This channel's videos are so High quality!
"Huge love from India 🇮🇳 can u do a roadmap for app/software development , AI/ML and cloud like AWS ❤"
"Hi Mosh, are we to learn data structure and algorithm in Python or data structure and algorithm?"
php crying in the corner 😂
can you make a roadmap video for blockchain developer?
You always leave PHP.
sir can you please guide me from where i should start learning.i m at scratch i mean i dont even have any basic knowledge of computer but i wanna learn about computer and become a computer scientist in ai field....please guide me
Mosh I have been watching your videos for a while and honestly you’re the best.lots of love from Iran.
ty
Thank you for confirming your subscription.  Please check your inbox for your free roadmap. i never got a roadmap mosh🥺
what about PHP back-end ..?
Is it a good sequence for learning? 1.programming language 2.frame work 3.mysql +git 4. algorithms + design patterns
Why not PHP 🙂
you can pick ABAP as well for backend ☺
بهنر نیست بجای express  فریم ورک nest رو یاد بگیریم؟
Can you make a roadmap a backend web with Node.js in javascript?
One of the best road map video
Complete route map in java Full stack
"hi thanks for your advices , unfortunately pdf isn't sent to me ;("
"Gess what there are no entry-level backend jobs out there. Most of them require at least 2-3 yoe. Also, you need to be proficient at one cloud platform, mostly AWS."
"If you saw my comment if I start learning with Python, then after I want to learn data structure and algorithm, then should I shift to Java course and then learn data structure and algorithm or what because if I shift to Java then it will be very tough for me to handle two programming languge right please answer me mosh"
Where I used to live C#/.NET completely dominates the labor market. Every single job ad will either ask for a .NET developer or say that' it's a beneficial if you know C#/.NET.
where is the intermediate course for java?
is there still a chance to start coding when youre already at your forty's. would like to add some tech skills... no prior bckground on coding though?
Can you tell me how django is structured in enterprise way like is there any design pattern for django. Will be great help if someone tells me :)
Please make a video on R language
"Hello @programmingwithmosh, can you upload video guide of the roadmap to become a strong DevOps engineer? Please, I really need it."
This is the most comprehensive video I've seen about backend development. Thank you for your service.
where is php? and laravel?
"Wowwww... perfect channel Mosh ..thank you very very much ..also I love this Hindi language, vocabulary is beyond me too !🎉❤"
I subscribed on the link and I didnt receive pdf roadmap
I started Js for back-End  See you after 3 months ❤
Django is best or not?
"I'm confused, I thought learning HTML and CSS was enough to get a job. So, I need one of these languages on top of HTML and CSS?"
Bye for now See you in 12 months
"I see mosh is using AI Voice Model trained on his voice, its bit obivous"
Add fastapi also
"Ruby is undoubtedly very good, perfect and laconic in comparison with the backward Python, but unfortunately, vacancies for Ruby remain only in Japan, of course I love anime, but I am not ready to learn Japanese, even for the sake of Ruby. Sorry Ruby, I learning Javascript."
Thank you for your videos. They are very beneficial. I have been working in Java for a few years but in recent times Kotlin has been popular and there are many openings in bigger companies for Koltin developers. I have been suggested by some of my friends to learn it. What is your take on this? Looking forward to your valuable reply.
"Ну да, я примерно так и думал, сроки обозначенные автором видео - это для гениев, чтобы через год с нуля стать разработчиком. Для обычного человека смело можно умножать на три и мы получим адекватную цифру в три года."
Arabic🔥🔥
why C# and Java are used in more serious projects? Are they any better?
" @maxkosh4839  They’re more solid languages than dynamic languages like JavaScript, Python and Ruby."
 @programmingwithmosh  what do you mean by solid?
"When someone visits my website and let’s say create an account, does my back end server automatically start. I write back end in Java (SpringBoot) but i have to start its server within the IDE for it to be able receive requests and send requests. If I’ve built my web app, front and back end connected. When a user visits my website, the front end server will run automatically, does the same also happen for the back end? I don’t know if I’ve tried to explain my question, it’s literally bugging me and I have no one to consult"
for me am using typescript for both frontend and backend so what i do you have to use CORS(cross origin resource sharing).because am using js i install the package cors using npm and i use it on my server.ts file.cross origin resource sharing is just a mechanism which two diffrent browser communicate and as the name suggest they share the resources.so if you are still in development you have to run both program.
"If anyone has got good notes for java backend ,could you please share it"
Thanks for the video Mosh. I am purchasing the membership soon. I just have a question. Are backend jobs entry level?
Dedicate 3-5 hours a day for the next 8-16 months 😂😂😂
Exactly what I was thinking. Maybe take a bootcamp course? with your country’s government schemes maybe you could get it for free?
​ @ilja9230  checkout freecodecamp Data Analyst BootCamp course.
Well with my time availability I'll be a data analyst in no time....I mean 2030 isn't that far away right....right..? 😭
"yeah, sounds more like data science but every country's different"
A lot of job descriptions aren’t asking for every single thing listed in the video.
Which of these would they be asking for?  ​ @papercliprain3222 
Love that there was no unnecessary intro ❤ You jumped straight to the point. Much needed relief in these times of clickbaits and irrelevant speeches at the beginning 😅
"Hi Mosh, can you please create a roadmap for Data Engineering."
Please sir! 😌 😌
Next Cyber Security plz
"Please mobile app development kotlin, swift or flutter 😍 except react native 🧸🧸"

Thank you for your hardwork Mosh ❤ Can you make a video on cybersecurity road map
Hi mosh! thank you for releasing useful contents. Can you please make one roadmap for blockchain software development?
I saw your video related to DATA ANALYST but my concern is which is the best place to learn all those which you have suggested for DATA ANALYST. if you could guide us to that as well then it will great help to follow
"mobile app development kotlin, swift or flutter except react native please"
I'm waiting for machine learning ❤
Me too…. AI and ML
Thnku sir
That was G R E A T ! thanks👍👏
Spring boot course would be cool

Beautiful! Thanks ❤for sharing
Hello Mr.Mosh Are you from (Kurdistan)? Because (Hamadan) is in the (EAST of Kurdistan)
I went to leaning path in your website but you dont have one for data engineering.
Thank you for great videos on roadmap can we get a roadmap on Internet of Things(IoT)❤
www.youtube.com/@Tsp_Academic
Hi mosh your videos help many understand basic concepts on understanding how technology works I think for your next video a cloud development road map would be beneficial.
i dont received the roadmap sir...how to get it ???
Next data engineer and business intelligence
"Pls make roadmap on cybersecurity like  ethical hacking, cybersecurity engineer, pentester, cybersecurity analyst ,etc. I m waiting..."
"I think your timeline is just too long, i would encourage 2 weeks on excel, 2 weeks sql, 1-2 months on Tableau, 3-months for python"
Does this roadmap build upon the previously learned skills or is there room for concurrent learning?
Devops  roadmap please

hy mosh! I'am from Pakistan. would you like to make a course on nestjs
your courses are outdated why?
Are python and excel still enough?
Hey Mosh! kindly do make a Cybersecurity  Roadmap as well.
Thank you
"DATA SCIENCE + SOFTWARE ENGINEERING = AI/ML ENGINEER Vote for AI/ML engineer roadmap ☑"
Only two monthes to get familiar with Math ! Are you crazy mosh ? people like you are eventually destroying the professional market . you shouldn't underrate these professions just soo much like this man . took a lifetime for me just to become a professional programmer . ( needing many fields and already laying the ground for just too many years of my life time ). You Are Wrong Man !
"If you have a strong background in math, programming and a good amount of domain knowledge, then you shouldn't worry too much about others getting into this field. I went through the PDF that he mentioned and find it a really good reference list for me who is already quite experienced. But I doubt if just about anyone who's merely interested in the subject can pull it off. Having supervised several projects myself, I think experience and domain knowledge is key to actually solve business problems in a good way. Just learning the stuff in that list wouldn't cut it. But if someone is willing to burn the midnight oil and really learn the stuff then they deserve the success. That's my opinion at least."
" @SolutionBuffet  no my point actually is, that after soo many years i am ( myself ) still not good enough ( in Math specially ) and i have diploma in math and bachelor in software engineering."
" @arash_samandar  Sorry, I misunderstood!"

Can you make one for data engineer? 🥺
I'm on it Mosh!
data structures and algorithms in python course please
"Just go through the PDF. It’s quite neat and clean, just like your videos. The way you explain which skills we need and which topics should be addressed is absolutely amazing. I knew that statistics and mathematics are important for data analysis, but I was never able to understand from where to begin and which topics should be covered under this. Thank you so much mosh❤❤  Only one request please provide free sources of learning those skills especially statistics/maths"
"Hello mosh,  I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and express my capability in providing audio translations. Whether it's for expanding your content's reach or catering to a diverse audience, I'm here to assist. Feel free to discuss your specific needs, and we can explore how I can contribute to enhancing your content through audio translation.  Best regards, __.paxtonnnn"
This is awesome and useful content thank you
pretty cool! 😎 now I know why I am not a Data Analyst 🤪
"I am 12th grade student and i am going to become an automation engineer so what subject should i focus on and like do i need to learn about python, c++, and javascript or only one of these enough for it?please respond."
Once we have mastered these all skills. Can you guide that from where can we get the projects of data which works on these platforms??????
Sample resume pls
Can you make 1 hour video on Ansible
Cloud engineer roadmap please

"Hi Sir, My question is that for freshers is there any openings on data analyst, actaully i am learning a powerbi and sql and advanced excel from past 2 months, but my quesation is companies are hiring the freshers are not."
any idea?
🔍 Just used Jeda.ai for my data analysis project and it exceeded expectations. The intuitive design and powerful tools made everything more efficient.
"Hi, can you create a roadmap for AI generative or"
"Hi moah, can you create road for Quality Analysis ❤"
"Thank you Mosh for this Roadmap, I really appreciate it"
Business analyst please
Hi mosh Please create a roadmap for cloud data engineers.
But I’m wondering if learning all these skills are worth it if the barriers to entry is only 16 months?
Hello I need this video in Spanish please.
I love Mosh any day. Thank you for this straight to the point video.
I did not get roadmap
🫸♥️🫷
That's create. And recommends to try bigdata tools like data.olllo that is a easy using but functional one.
can we know the resources where we can follow the roadma?
Thanks for using  Urdu language.
Thank you 😊
"I speak hindi, still this pure Hindi is tough to understand"
AI ka sahi istemal koi inse sikhee 🤣
Good information
"Thanks for the video, it gives me some insight into what I need to know to become a Data Analyst, I am a couple of weeks into learning Python but there is a long road to go. Thanks for the Road Map."
"Thank you MOSH, great video"
Don't you have a full tutorial on  Excel?  Very enlightening video btw
"listen im a new stay at home mom. I have about 6 hours each day to study, how fast can I learn these to get a job asap?"
next GameDev?
Well explained Sir. Thank you.
Sir please launch a data analyst course ASAP
Thanks for the great video. In my part I'm exploring the data visualization from raw data. (Excel and Flourish)
Like me if u wanna be ML engineer 🎉
I just applied for an ML Engineer!
you need masters or phd level knowledge.
Super like. Not everyone wants to be a faker scientists.
So what happen if I like you
"MASTERING Linear Algebra, Probability, Calculus and Statistic in only 2 to 3 months?! I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible. It takes a whole semester if you take these courses in a university and you'd still have to pass calculus 2."
There's absolutely nothing that can be mastered in 2/3 month. What he meant was to have a good grasp of what it is and being comfortable in it.
"Well, I prepared for my calculus 2 exam in like 2 days without going to class. I don't think it's that complicated."
 @philtejeda3110  you just learn for passing but @lejen1925 is compleltly right .there is a huge difference
 @philtejeda3110  lmao real
It depends on your background I think
in India we do 12 chapters as hard as calculus in 1 month
" @Mrweeeeeb  Sure but you definitely don't ""master"" all of them."
 @lejen1925  believe me we can do it university level ez
It took me 6 months plus discrete math 😵‍💫
 @lejen1925  yeah but we can solve till university level which is quite high
"Yeah, not to mention that they build on each other, studying Statistics at a high level without knowing the other three (I would even add analysis) it's.... challenging."
We indians literally do it every semester
 @KESARSHARMA-bd2ek  fr that also multiple subjects at once
" @KESARSHARMA-bd2ek  no you don't. it actually isn't possible to ""master"" multiple fields in only a semester."
 @lejen1925  we don't master the subject we master the exam
 @KESARSHARMA-bd2ek  then that's not exclusive to your universities. basically every good university is like that.
 @lejen1925  bro which country are you from??
 @KESARSHARMA-bd2ek  Iran
 @lejen1925  ARE YOU A BEGINNER?
" @KESARSHARMA-bd2ek  I'm on 5th simister, my major is mathematics"
make a video on cybersecurity and ethical hacking skills to be learnt.
Yes please.
Yes please
You can go to YouTube and search there are Tons of tutorials
Yes! That will be awesome
CEH V12 (or higher) will help you
"The math part is just delusional or exaggerated to sound easy.  I studied computer science at TUM. All those math modules combined would be 30 university credits, each representing 30 HOURS, resulting with 900 in total. On average, this is enough to barely pass the exams. He's talking about self study in a non-professional environment and ""mastering"" it in 2-3 months, this is crazy. It would take 22 full-time weeks to get 900 hours with good resources at hand, but ""mastering"" would only be possible for the 3%, optimistically speaking."
Not sure about credits and stuff but yeah those maths topics will take way more time to understand.
​ @khizarstudy2095  but it's still worth the effort. After fighting through the courses I really learned to appreciate maths and how to use it as a language.
who wants complete data science course on python by Mosh ?? like here
"if not dislike, ok?"
Dude!!! You gotta start a Data Science course.   - Universities are sh*t in these areas. and not only do we have to spend massive money on Tuition but also another massive money on online courses to cover for what university is doing.  - I also rely on you so much because you give the course in such fun way to love coding Plus to make it entertaining to watch unlike Collage. You also make us do exercises and then you make step by step solutions on what we missed. Honestly with your courses Universities doesn't stand a chance.  - You will find a lot of students here or even graduates apply to your courses if you make a Data Science course. I know it's tough to make. but Honestly I think No one like you make coding that much fun.  I hope you consider making these courses. <3
Then why I'm wasting 4 years in college 🤓
Cause you fell for the meme
Just for degree bro 😅
It's not as easy as it has been shown 😂
"Guess you want a degree, that's cool too."
 @Alex-eu6rw  wat meme?
This is why alot of people quit Data Science. You need to learn everything in the world.
"So... this is a field for the passionately curious, sound good to me!"
"please, if you can, make a Cyber Security roadmap. I need it so much"
Yes it would be nice and so much informative.
Yesss
"that's what I was looking for ,thank u Mosh for this awesome informative video 🤗"
Next Cyber Security Roadmap plz❤
❤
"Mosh you are my number one instructor 2 years ago i watched you javascript and currently im full stack developer both java and react/next js i want to thank you, and why you dont make course in spring boot or jhipster??"
"Thank you, my friend! I'd love to create a Spring Boot course. The problem is: I'm one person and are loaded with so many course requests! I wish I could clone myself and do all the courses in parallel."
"Haaaa, that is sp funny #Mosh, I'm really exited for your replay and i love your teaching"
​ @programmingwithmosh is there any video Mosh doesn't make mention of the 80 20 rule ?😂
 @programmingwithmosh  let's do that with AI 😂😂
CAN YOU create roadmap for data analysts?
Coming next week
Cyber security roadmap please
all along i was used to think i am a data scientist 😭😭😭😭😭
Useful and enriching information that enlightens us on the path to the world of data science. Thank you Mosh
Still waiting for devops
Plz make a full course for data science...🙏👍👍
Can You make a roadmap for CyberSecurity
"Thanks for the video. I'm not set on becoming a data scientist, but it's reassuring to see that with a background as a software engineer, and previously data analyst, pivoting towards data scientist would not require a lot of efforts."
"Many companies consider processing big data and data wrangling as part of data scientist's job, so big data should be learnt earlier in the roadmap, perhaps after getting familiar with numpy and Pandas. Second, getting familiar with a public cloud is not mentioned here, which is also an essential skill in many jobs.   The specifics often depends on the role, and the job expectations vary widely, some focusing more on the Data Science side, and other roles like ML Engineer focus somewhat more on data engineering and product building side.   So use this well put together roadmap as a framework, and tweak it according to your career goals."
"Hi mosh, your free roadmap link is not letting me download it"
"hi ,sir I am your student and subscriber from pakistan can I get your coplete your python course for free I am in high school and have weak background status you put 14$ for first 200 students but in my country its equal to 4000 . please I am really ecited to learn it from you"
"Mosh, Do you have a course that a complete Data Science course? I want to see if there is course that covers all the aspects"
first one
Can you do game development roadmap? Love you from the UK ❤❤❤
"Dear Mosh Sir, Which is better to learn Web dev or Data science?  You know about AI So which development is the safest job in the upcoming years? I am the final year student. So plz plz... Reply me as soon as possible  Thank you! Or anyone can tell me which is better and safe and why?"
Nice information
This is wonderful. Well done 👍
"I’m currently taking your SQL course. Hoping to take PowerBI, then projects, then Python next. A data analyst track with tutorials on these other parts will be helpful (especially PowerBI)"
So machine learning is part of data science?
"Sir, do you intend to make a course on Flutter in future? If so, please reply. I want a Flutter course."
one thing which I wanted to ask is that can I do DSA in C++ instead of Python even in Data Scientist role?
"go for DSA in Python dude!!, python makes more sense in a data scientist role and it is more convenient as compared to C++"
next career path for software engineers
This was very helpful
I really appreciate all the effort you put in and I promise I will do my best to return the favor.
Thanks for sharing. Really appreciate it. ❤

Hi mosh! can you make one for blockchain software development please?
Sir how can  I download the road map...I didn't get my mail id...
Interesting roadmap. I'm currently making a carreer change from accounting to data science and this roadmap helps a lot.
Hai bro ..how to download road map..I didn't get on mail
 @PavithraS-gb8mn  check your spam or unwanted mails.
Would love to go this route but I sux at math now as I rarely use anything besides basic math haha
Please make a roadmap on DevOps
Thank you so much for this Mosh🖤!
"Thank you for the energy, time, and effort you put into this video you are an amazing researcher. Why does anyone never make a road map for cybersecurity? Please, we need a road map for Cybersecurity, thanks in advance 🙏🙏"

Weldone Mosh. We hope to also get there one day
"next, path to AI engineer"
"then what is the difference between ML engineer and data scientist, the roadmap you shown for machine learning completely comes under this video"
I am studying right now to become a ML Engineer and are soon going to apply for internships. I've felt like I don't know enough (Impostor syndrome) but seeing this video made me feel better. As I have knowledge in every step but deep learning which is a course I will have soon. Thank you so much!
Thank you for this invaluable content. Please make a video on the road map of Data Engineering
"Bro i just did bsc in physics ,now i am thinking about switching . But I don't really know what to do"
hi Mosh. Do you have any promo or offer code for yearly  subscription on your website course? Or amy upcoming offer?
Can anyone tell me... Full roadmap for data science as beginner?
"Commenters, Which is a good pick for data science masters a Mac or a windows"
Please make a roadmap for cloud also
Thanks for the video! The link to the pdf file doesnt work.
"If you are going to follow this roadmap, consider adding sections on soft skills and communication, project management and Agile methodologies, ethics and data privacy, domain knowledge, advanced machine learning techniques, cloud computing and data engineering, and practical projects and portfolio development.  Good Luck! 🎉"
"For an entry-level job, 3-4 hours per day for 1.5 years. You'll get an entry-level job"
Please make a video on AI Engineers
Thanks Mosh for listening my request ❤
Thank you Sir
👏
"Thank you for making this video, this video helps me focus on the important things so that I don't waste too much time."
Make a video on data analytics also
"Please, make a data analytics roadmap."
I'm going through the python foundations now @ functions currently..Subscribed to a structured 95 hour udemy course for Data science covering all the above mentioned topics!!!!
if possible pls send that 95 hr course
Are you going to make a full course for data science? I know you teach some of the things you need to know for it.
From a non tech background which is better for career switch data scientist or devops engineer ... Can anybody help?
Which book is best for Mathematics and statistics'?
Data Analyst course HINDI playlist on youtube   https://youtu.be/YBCIVtP8hKM
please don't i need to learn javascript?
"Valuable and insightful content that guides us on our journey into the field of data science. Thanks, Mosh!"
can u provide cyber security roadmap plzzzz
is dsa in python a good choice or should i go for dsa in java?
Where to code
Hello Mosh. Is DSA really important in Data science?
Same doubt
​ @MonikaVyas-xc8hz  It is asked in interview so yea
"Please have been searching for your data science bootcamp the one you uploaded on YouTube, can you share the link with me, thank you"
"I appreciate the value your video provides, serving as a soothing experience and a catalyst for ideas. It is not uncommon for individuals to express complaints, however, what truly matters is the effort you have invested in structuring knowledge. By organizing the learning pathway, you have made a significant contribution, despite potential criticisms. I hope to convey my success to you in August 2026, from Maine, USA."
"sir , i interested data science , but i have problem cant spoken , data science a lot talk communcation skills ? , i know basic data science"
like
I am not receiving your data science roadmap in my mail even after verifying everything
Could you make a video about AI road map?
thank you @programming with Mosh .I have an Doubt ? Which Language I have to Choose for DSA whether its Python or JAVA or C++ .
Totaly how much time it will take
How can I learn it online?
"When I download and watch this video, it's on a different language. Why not in English?"
How did you make your terminal this beautiful 🤩
"for all people out there, don't waste your time energy and money buying this road mao, create your own road map with the help of AI👍"
One additional skill is data scraping which will help to collect data from various sources :)
One of the jobs that AI gonna take over FAST
"why is AI learning being encompassed into this, for a data scientist it doesn't seem necessary"
Благодаря тебе стал разбираться в арбитраже и связках)
It was a pretty good and easy explanation thank you ❤
I am an electrical engineer. Can I proceed with my masters degree in data science? How much difficult will it be for me to master the skills I need to become a successful data scientist?
good part for me that i already have data sicence skills. i just have to figure out the part that misses in puzzle
Are you kidding me ? You spend 3 months and you're gonna master these : 2:22 ? What a funny guy hahah
"Explore various AI/ML specializations, such as natural language processing or computer vision, to identify your specialty and expand your knowledge."
"I'm dive into this world and is amazing,  Is not  easy but the learning process is amazing Is the most challenge that I'd ever had. 😍"
Amazing guidlines
For Data science and machine learning  Window 11 single display language laptop is good OR not
"I never seen a video like  yours 🙇 roadmap for data science is very informative. Thankyou Sir, can you upload videos about data science please.... it's very useful for us."
20 months is about 3% of life
Mosh we don't need roadmaps we need content
I disagree! This is useful!
 @Life.Love.Locs.  Everyone has its own opinion. I respect.
"Speak for yourself. Please don't count me in your ""we"""
 @jakeowen9091  Respect. But the like count already answered it. Take it as a poll.
Roadmaps are also as essential as content coz without any path no one can learn anything
Are you requesting or commanding?  If you already know the road map why are you still here? Go to other website and buy yourself courses and move on
 @Sreeeeeeeekrishna  I'm now sock of it. Organized content videos are themselves roadmaps. Most of us can't buy courses so we are on youtube.
 @PingingMath  It's a 2 day old video. why would you make such conclusions?
We need content around these roadmaps is a better way to put it
​ @jakeowen9091  Get a life man
Ok this is also a content
Without this u can get to nowhere
He literally says in this video he has content on his website.
​ @Life.Love.Locs.  what kind of species are you?
*slow clap from the back of the toom *
Yes I also disagree because so many people are learning so many courses without roadmaps and it consumes a lot of  time and money..  Hey mosh you continue and finish roadmaps and the courses 👏
Thank mosh
Right
Please make a course for devops
upping this
up
Yes
"Hi Mosh, Please create videos on Networking concepts, as they are difficult for many people including me to visualize. Your videos with simple, structured explanations and animations would help in better understanding these concepts."
Same here. Good network content is kinda limited.
"I don't really need this but I watched till the end because I really love Mosh explanations it really clear, detailed ❤ and anyone can watch it."
Please sir do the Cybersecurity roadmap 🙏
"I don't know why Mosh didn't mention it in his video, but you need to know DevOps is not a junior friendly job and you need in most cases real world experience to get a job. It's not like Front-End, Software engineering or Data Analysis jobs. So think twice if you wanna spend 10-14 months for learning all these materials."
"If I wanna be a DEVOPS so,what job position should I start as a junior?What career field I should start I mean networking or web developer or cloud?"
​ @ssu371 I've seen people moving from Linux/DB Admins OR Software Developers find it easier to transition to DEVOPS.
Yeah we get it it’s not junior friendly none of the roles in tech are but you have to start somewhere
"​@ssu371 Doesn't matter, do whichever be it on the dev or ops side, get experience and breadth of knowledge, learn the other side (e.g. if you started via dev side, learn some ops skill), get involved in every stage of SDLC, learn some skills cloud skills and do devops related work before migrating to devops. Make sure its in a role you actually like and not doing it for the sake of it.   I started as front end dev, then automated testing for 2yrs, carried out some devops work (bringing about continuous delivery,  setting up standards and procedures for making better software, forcing devs to test properly before handing off new updates) and found myself in devops role. Devops mean different thing to different organisation, it's less about knowing technologies and more about doing shit to improve business processes and deliver high quality software quickly."
​ @StevieWondersEyes is it possible to People that cannot / bad at coding to go with this DevOps career path ?
"@cutoff-v2  That depends on the route you're taking and whether that job is developer role or not. There is no entry level jobs for DevOps, any ads that say so often are just aysadmin roles or a business attempting to severely underpay for a devops engineer. If you're bad at coding and are going through swe route, then get better at it via experience. Also there's much more to an swe role than coding.  Pick any role in tech, get good at that role, get wide range of experience and then transition to DevOps. Don't blindly follow for the sake of money."
 @StevieWondersEyes  thanks
"Awesome video as always, can you do one for Cyber security? Thanks!"
"This is the best DevOps Road map video that I have ever seen. It is perfectly explained, simple, concise and highly accurate. Thanks a lot Mosh !🎉❤"
"please help me with the roadmap , I did not get it in my inbox"
"Nice Content Mosh, Hope you  Make Cyber Security Roadmap"
@mosh Do you have a DevOps course now ?
"Im an aboslute newbie to IT, no degree or anything...infact i think i failed in my last school exams lmao. Im currently learning to code python..once i've done that i will learn advanced basics on help desk, fault finding etc etc then as quickly as possible aim to study AWS/cloud software and devops etc hopefully it doesn't take longer than a year maybe 18months until i can go for a job. Amen✝️"
"All the best champ, you've got this! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾"
Can you make a video why do we need to learn DevOps in details?
can we have an explanation about the devOps or subject of the Video next time?
Woow that is the content that I was looking for! You're awesome !
"We need roadmaps Mosh, keep it up!"
We would love if you could add more courses in your website or even update them a bit 🙏🏼
"Are you ""Gurus"" now on roadmap to completely annihilate another great CS/IT infrastructure just like you did with Software Engineering and website developers bootcamp mushrooming?, with endless promises of heavenly future ? Isn't it enough being a part of bubble creating  business and pushing loads of really unqualified masses into big tech with cheep promises as we witnessed its crumbling to pieces recently with mass layoffs, depressed engineers.. which was a thriving industry just recently! .... Anyone reading this post, take my advice and don't get your feet wet with this ""cool maps"" learning this or that paradigms, frameworks, tools, etc. without earning Bachelors degree(minimum) and even better Masters in CS/IT/EE/CE so you'll have some value and ground to stand upon, on the face of harsh reality of the tech world !"
"Bachelors in CS? Are you joking? Masters I can understand, but the vast majority of those degree programs are academic circle jerks with VERY LITTLE industry transferable knowledge with the exception of those who participated in internships. Not to mention an absolute minimum price tag of $40,000 for that garbage. As a UMD CS  graduate THE CURRICULUMS AT THESE UNIVERSITIES ARE A JOKE. The well-disciplined self-taught and occasional bootcamp programmers with extensive portfolio projects are typically miles ahead of bachelors degrees in software in the technologies that matter. As a web developer, I don’t need someone to write me fucking bubblesort in Java but doesn’t know what html tags are…"
good
"Thanks Mosh ❤, Please Make Cloud Architect Roadmap ,"

"This is for me. your way of Explanation is super amazing . By following this amazing road map, I will be an AI Engineer After three Years (from non-IT and at the age of 37)!!! I am from ETHIOPIA. this is my dream. Thank you Mr. Mosh."
"thank you mosh, this is incredibly useful"
Please make full AI/ML course for us it’s really helpful….thank you 🙏
yeah this will be benefitial
"Yes I always wished for such course. Including ML, NN, DL, NLP, CV.   It will be a game changer in mylife and many."
mosh please create complete course on machine learning or data science please
yes please!
Yes please
Yes!!!

"An easier way you might have the chance of him listening to you, is by subscribing to his newsletter and sending a feedback after receiving the mail he sends every Thursday morning. It contains tips that will help you become a better programmer including weekly challenges. I say so cause I did the same and seeing this video is a proof for me that he read my feedback mail. The link is in the description. Mosh is just the best 💯"
I want to learn AI in 6 months. Is that possible?
"yes if you work 15 hours a day, consistently"
​ @spsdarinda4834  oh god help with this one..!😢
"It depends on your learning methods, your focus, time and generally how well does it all stick. It's not impossible, but very small percentage of folk will be able to do it, 6 months is really not much. And even if, those 6 months will get you the absolute basics. Don't give yourself any static deadlines with something as complex as AI/ML. Rather, make a milestone calendar and get advice from someone experianced. Believe me it helps a lot. Assess your progress in intervals, and grind and apply your knowledge iteratively, meaning increase the size and the complexity of your projects in small steps."
"i didnt get the link to roadmap file, and emailed to Mosh with ask to send me one. He sent it in half an hour. Thank you , Mosh! My respect!"
"Big thanks Mosh,,I am a great beneficiary of this content from #Kenya"

Hi @Mosh can this roadmap be used for AI Engineering too and also are the programming courses from Harvard's CS50 course series good for this kind of job?
Thank you for making this video ❤
"We need DA roadmap, please make a video on this topic."
Roadmap link doesn't work
I just downloaded it. You can try using the link again
Congratulations
"Mosh, how do I know if I am ready to work remotely with foreign countries in the field of front-end or after learning back-end as a full stack developer?"
"Hi Mosh, please create a tutorial on AWS. I've noticed this requirement in every job description."
"Mosh we are waiting for your Machine Learning Course, We can't learn from anywhere else because we've gotten used to you.😁 So when we are getting this course??"
How to learn machine learning with JS?
tensorflow JS library
pleeeeeeeeeease mosh make a complete tutorial on your channel on machine learning and AI from beginner to advance.  We are million of students waiting for such course🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
3 month in calculus algebra statistics and probabilities ☠☠
please make on data scientist as well
Hey Mosh love your all videos...Please make a roadmap video on data scientist in 2024.. please please
Am I the only one not getting a road map?
Thank you very much for the roadmap😃... I've one question Can I learn first mathematics and statistics then master the python? Will it work if I do this
Mosh is the guy you want to learn from. I've been learning a lot from his channel for years! Never stop Mosh! :D
Hi Mosh can you pls teach spring boot framework with mongodb database it's your student humble request.
I have a PhD degree in mathematics. I want to make my future in Machine Learning and AI. Is it also applicable to me?
yes
is your  complete course follow this roadmap?
Thank you
We need web 3 roadmap please 😊
first comment much love mosh
First 🥇
Please provide a *list of topics* that needs to be learnt under *Data Structures & Algorithms* module.
"Mosh has a great three-part course for this topic. If I remember right, it happens to be done in Python as well!"

Your visuals are killing .
Please send the spring boot course fast.
mosh please create complete course on machine learning.
"I'm 24 yrs really concerned about creating a mobile app for b2b2c platform for my country. It keeps me awake at night, but at the same time i haven't driven through coding full I sampled c# in Chinese college I couldn't continue, now my lives in USA. Should I hire a developer in my country to do it or go through it myself to maintain the flavor of the app."
I mean why DSA

Would you leave us link 🔗 under the comments section that helps us to follow each step ? Thanks 🙏
Please give us a road map to master the required math
thanks for the roadmap mosh your my favorite coding Guru
Hey mosh I really find your road maps useful. Can you also make a complete roadmap for cybersecurity and ethical hacking? I can't seem to find a proper path ❤
Computer networking roadmap
congrats for the 4m! Please do a roadmap for cloud as well! <3
"Hold onto your hats, here's important refund info"
"Dear, I'm stuck with business intelligence and machine learning job description, can you brief with that"
is there an area in software engineering that you don't have specialty?
Spring boot course really really need it
Mosh i clicked on roadmap but I didn't receive it yet
Which language we should choose for a dsa .python or java ??? @programmingwithmosh
Mosh my question is how I know that I need to go advance because in normal classes offline teacher teach us that we have understand the basics now need to go advance but In online I know that I need to go  advance?
consistency is the most important skill
"Just an advice, don't learn machine learning especially if u r a self taught with 0 experience in development industry, However, I believe it's better to start your career as full stack developer then you can start to learn and grow."
Do you have any plan to create ML course?
"If we need to study, if we have ai  can recplace us?"
very good information.Thank you from Nepal.
I am a web developer and I don't think I want it.   😊 Video is cool so thanks😊
"Hi Mosh, Jazak Allah khair. Could you please create a whole video series on ML engineering? Appreciate your efforts in your videos. I really needed this ML engineering playlist"
Mosh when are you uploading Cyber security
Is the roadmap   same for data science.  Someone enlighten me please
Thank you so much!! I was looking for a video like this
"Mosh this is helpful, but I have a problem on DSA. How deep does someone need to learn DSA? Is a comprehension and dedication that cover all concepts needed. I am still on this point in the roadmap you have pulled up. It's a great dilemma for me. Do I need to grasp everything including graph theory, AVL trees, tries and all the other complicated Data structures and algorithms?"
Thanks a lot for your helpful recommendations. hope you the best.
واقعا عالی بود و ذهنم رو خیلی باز کرد. دمتون گرم ❤❤ یه سوالی خیلی وقته ذهنمو درگیر کرده. من ۳ ساله بک اند کار میکنم با جنگو (همین الانشم در شرکتی مشغولم) و از اول دوست داشتم که بیام سمت هوش مصنوعی (اما بک اند رو هم دوست دارم) میشه لطفا راهنمایی ایم کنید چجور میتونم تغیییر شغل بدم از بک اند به هوش مصنوعی؟ و آیا این انتخابم کار درستیه و می ارزه؟ تو ایران زندگی میکنم. نمیخوام یهویی و به کلی شغل فعلی ام رو بی خیال شم و برم وقت بذارم روی هوش مصنوعی که قطعا این کار اشتباهه
Please make a roadmap video for web3
"pretty good idea but I would recommend giving it your all. Read books ,go for paid courses, watch youtube videos. I started my journey 5 months ago but everyday there is something to learn in ML. There is still OLS which performs better when it comes linear regression modules han scikit-learn. There is still time series to learn,most of the data is collected over time,on a daily basis,monthly,yearly and so on. Download datasets from Kaggle and UCI to practice even more ,give it your all!!! Code,be consistent and all the best."
"We love you Mosh❤. You are the best teacher for me and my team.🫡 Will you make machine learning courses, that would be great if you do. If Mosh has it we won't bother searching elsewhere."
"Greetings from Karabakh, Azerbaijan!"
Is this map the same for a Data scientist roadmap please?? I did statistics in the university so I'm sure am ar advantage here?
Josh will you please a complete course on Machine learning  step by step please ....
"I call malarky on the math. 2-3 months to learn Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability? What do you define as learning them? How long do you spend a day?"
Please create a roadmap for generative ai engineer
Polite reques please can you add a Vanilla Javascript to your Javascript Course please I Only want to learn it from you please Mr Mosh.
Data structure and algorithms with Java or c++  Which is best
Do I need to learn web developement to deploy or make my project in ML ?
Nice! Please make a video on ethical hacking roadmap.
Thank you. I confirmed subscription but no roadmap yet even after checking spam
it would be great  if you can create AI/ML  full course for us it’s really helpful .  you can celebrate on 4 million subs on behalf creating such a course
"Guys, where can I learn all of these?"
"🎉 Congrats on reaching 4 million subscribers, Mosh! 🎉 You truly deserve it and so much more. I've learned a ton from your amazing content!  ✨ Second, how about a complete boot camp on Go and microservices? Go is rapidly growing and seems to be the future of programming. A comprehensive course on microservices in Go would be incredibly valuable.  If anyone else is interested, hit the like button to get Mosh's attention! 👍 Let's make this happen!"
Congratulations Mosh for 4 million subscribers. I am waiting for your course on FastAPI.
Please do an game development
"Hi, Thanks for sharing ML roadmap. Do you have foundation courses on these topics and tools on your site? If yes plz share list."
Do I have a manual?
"Hey everyone, does anyone know where I can find more PDF materials from Mosh? That would be super helpful."
Make video for devops and cloud and about automation
"Really great content! Keep it up!! 👍   I have a question.....I have learnt the ML models and in the next semester, I'll be enrolling in the deep learning course but I don't know how to create end to end products in ML? I mean if I train a model, what type of software or app do I need to make to  allow the business developers or other potential clients to enter data and use the pre trained model to get predictions? Plz suggest?  Should I learn flutter to make apps that use my models? What steps will be involved?"

Wow! Thanks for your support my friend. I’m glad my videos have helped you grow and become successful! Sending you my best wishes ❤
Tell me for quantum computer and blockchain
"hello mosh, could you also create roadmap for data engineers as well. thank you."
"I am currently a final year mechanical engineering student, is it a good idea to get into this field and what about the pay, is it high paying?"
"You are amazing, Mosh!"
Thank you mosh for this video. Please create video for AI and deep learning roadmap also.
Next video ERPnext please 🙏🏿
Hi @programmingwithmosh should I learn C for the Machine Learning Engineer job
"Hi mosh hamedani, make a roadmap video for data analyst"
Patiently waiting for DevOps
"Sir, you are a legend..❤"
Sir thanks a lot for this video. But where to exactly search for these entry-level ML roles as a fresher. It's very hard to find.
Programming Languages
Thank you for everything Mosh 🙂
Understanding how to create AI agents from scratch with Python can be rewarding. Have you considered media like SmythOS to make the process easier? They have some great tools.
Did not recieve  the roadmap PDF even after subscribing.👇
"Same, the roadmap ain't getting delivered"
you are my first programming teacher. Thank you for your video tutorial on Python. That was my starting point.
Can someone share the roadmap? I can't get it emailed to me
"I have a question how did you animate this video, great content by the way."
"Thanks a lot Mosh, this is so useful ❤ I have a question... I'd like to develop a Trading bot. Should I learn about Machine learning? or something else?"
was so helpful.Good Luck...
"I did tried the data science and ML route for a while but not my Cup of tea, its boring tbh. In addition one con that i see with ML and Data Science is that it can't be freelanced and sold as a skill like in enterprise software development. With Software development you can build digital products and sell them while with Machine learning jobs ypu usually have to be on site and no company would share their data remotely or as a freelance Project."
"Jah bless, lol accidentaly I learned statistics in university because I studied a social science, didn't finished because I was into programming because I discovered it after 2021 finals and I entered in 201 university. And I have been all this time learning programming, data, sql, algorithms, math because I like math too much, I love more programming and I realise math is just programming but with more simbols and less abstraction or more abstraction? xd So lol I just need to understand how to graphic data and then I can dive into machine learning, thank you for the helping hand, ai is pretty complex field"
What's the salary for someone with all this knowledge? I want to know if it's worth venturing into this field.
also congrats from Ethiopia
Is Python enough for this road map?
Yap
Where can I find videos for Machine learning concepts?
"This is a crazy roadmap thanks. This roadmap takes more time than any IT-related field, right?"
Perfect Sir!!
isnt it advised to use c++ for data struct and algo?? so if i get proficient with python woudn't be a problem in this??
the best guide i have ever seen.
"Hi Mosh, I am so glad to have found this video. It came at the time I need it most, if you do not mind, I am making an offer to myself through you that, I am committing the next 12 months strictly following this guide. Thankfully, I have subscribed to a number of your courses already. So help me, Mosh and God!. I would be great to refer to resources on subjects that you do not have a video on. That would be so great, Sir"
can you write nere each of topics  your courses . i like how you teach  and what courses is in udemy or in your site
"Hi Mosh, harmless advice, you are super amazing, it would be great if you curated these roadmaps into a playlist so it's easy for anyone to access them."
"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Whosoever believeth in Jesus Christ should not perish, but have everlasting life. Please come to Jesus Christ, He loves you."
VERY USEFUL
Thank you dear sir 🙏😊
"why is python, it's slow language."
There are NO entry level machine learning engineering jobs. They want you to have many years of experience in a very technical job such as software engineering to be even somewhat qualified. And many programmers in that space have master's or PHDs even though that isn't necessarily a requirement. 12 months is incredibly unrealistic. More like 4-5 years.
Bro I have chosen AIML this year only and now I can’t change it so what should I do now ?
 @rexxarbgmi4650  You could go into software development. More entry level for beginner programmers. AI algorithms are much more complicated and advanced.
My Best Instructor ever. Thank you Mosh.
"Hey mosh, I used the link in the description for the roadmap, but did not receive it."
You could do some machine learning apps using javascript with Tensor-flow JS
"I think it's hard to get an entry level job in Machine Learning. It's easier to begin in a job that works with data, like data analyst or data scientist, before jumping into the ML career."
My university stright up skipped to last 2 steps 🤡 no mathematics no nothing.
Thank you so much 😊😊
"When moving on to complicated algorithms, an AI/ML roadmap should first cover fundamental principles in programming, statistics, and linear algebra."
Game developer roadmap please
great video finally getting to catch some of the basics through a project based tutorial wish is a great way to know how to implement the basics thank you for your effort
Why it is too similar to your Data Science roadmap! 😅😅... Ya I watch both of them! 😂
Awesome vid. Exactly what I needed. Thank you.
Thanks for Hindi audio track
The script for this video was itself generated using AI 😭
Thank you it was very good. But I have a problem with one part: it's a bit unrealistic to think we can deploy a model to production using Docker
"Let's connect guys, let's learn together"
"Yup, immediately stop the video at python and heading over to those videos now. And that's going to be my life until I understand everything in this roadmap step by step the slow long journey. Thanks Mosh."
i will do 10 push ups for every like

"Actually the world needs ""Job Development Roadmap"" nowadays"
🤣
Fr
THIS! I have not coded since Open AI's Chatgpt launched.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.......... Where's the lie?
What's Job Development?
​ @TransformEveryday-su2mn  good thing and bad thing at same time
" @denniszenanywhere  not hard if you werent coding before,chatgpt can't even write above beginner code,it just dies on itself or write very bad code that you spend more time correcting"
 @abdelhakimhamidi-zv4qs  But do employers know that? Or they'd rather risks bad code than hire people?
 @denniszenanywhere No real software developers job is at risk due to chatbots on steroids. People who actually believe that are just making excuses to give up learning a new skill.
" @denniszenanywhere  they know that, trust me."
 @denniszenanywhere  lol you are not fit so can not
 @denniszenanywhere  bad code doesnt work at all.. I notice a lot of software is buggy but that's magnitudes better than bad code
" @ezradlionel711  So if jobs are hard to get, it's not because of AI, right? It's saturated perhaps?"
 @denniszenanywhere  I'm a developer and an artist.. AI is a god Send.. Humans have no chance if they dont evolve...  I used to  feel sorry for some people but ignorance is a choice now  I have like 30 years programming experience but I dont even work in IT right now but I use everything I know to make my current work easier.. My coworkers are in their 20s and early 30s and refuse to even use google docs to make their work easier but keep trying to roast me for being old.. I will gladly hand in my current project that's going to make them obsolete
I will Study Web Development for 1 Like = 1 Hour !!!!
lets push this guy to learn more hours😆😆
 @hgn007  thank you brother! Letting you know that ...  I am actually spending most of my time studying web development.
You're one of the few ppl who recommend backend first and I 100% agree. I think there is so much to learn from the backend that makes the front end a breeze. Good on you mate!
frontend a breeze are you kidding me? frontend is gotta be the most complicated stuff out there getting designs to reality
"Hahaha🤣🤣... You have lot more to learn in frontend, you have to be more versatile learn alot of different techs in frontend."
 @vishnusidharth9309  hes a newbie probably let him be.
lol I’m sorry but have you tried taking off your pink glasses?
Bro fronted is so hard I just started 4 days ago and I’m struggling just to put stuff inline 😂😭😭🙏🏾
" @Xj_77_L , leave this guy's comment. The front end is the most irritating and difficult to adjust. There are so many libraries and packages to choose from, each with pros and cons."
Guys who want cloud computing engineer roadmap 🔥🔥
I am interested
Can you share me the roadmap link
Everything is Perfect if you could include PHP and Laravel to this. Great Work!
Especially those of us more likely to freelance.
I would agree with Enigma if you could include PHP & Laravel
​ @ViewSonic88729  laravel is php
"Wait, where is PhP?"
I've just asked that same question...
lol but c++ included😂
I always wanted you to make this video thank you moshh❤❤
"Congrats on reaching 4 million subscribers, Mosh!  You truly deserve it and so much more. I've learned a ton from your amazing content!

Thanks for your kind words and support! I’ve been thinking about a Go course. Thanks for the suggestion.
" @programmingwithmosh  Hey Mosh, please think about Django Latest Course"
​ @programmingwithmosh  I also think that a Go course would be a great add on to your platform
"It's getting more confusing each day, I was once told front-end is the best place to start. because It has an easier learning curve, and also, no company would employ a junior back-end developer. (Where you have to handle people's data and stuff) 🤷‍♂️"
Start  with the thing excite you the most as the better aria to start  is relative(will always  depend on who you're asking to)
 @juniorMr  thats a  great advice if you start with something you dont feel excited you will just quit it in a few days
I can't believe I'm 3/4 of this road map. Feels like yesterday when I had just started
Bhai konsa playlist se kar rahe ho?? Aap LINK BHEJ NA BRO??
So did you land a job and how much time did it take?
 @targaryen5168  mn I've landed a good internship and it took me one year of which I wasted like 4 months.
 @targaryen5168  it took me a year of which I wasted like 4 months of it. Just focus on one language like python and then learn a framework for it like Django
I've landed a good internship. It took me 1 year of which I wasted like 4 months. Just focus on one language like python and Django.
"​ @epic3548  I did Django for a couple months a year and a half ago for CS50w. I coded a bunch of janky websites that were functional, but I just did the bare minimum to pass. For some life circumstances, I wasn't able to code for the past year. Now I'm finally in a position where I can work on it a lot, and I've started learning React around 2 weeks ago. I hope to be able to merge these two skills and make some projects to put in my portfolio. The goal is to get an internship to gain actual real world experience.   It's awesome that you've been able to land an internship. It inspires me to keep working hard."
Where did you learn from?
 @Bookandchai  youtube
please bring springboot full stack course on your website
"Yes, please. 🙏🏽"
do you want to learn mern stack development
"This is WAAAY too complicated. You only need like half of these. Also, Linux should absolutely be mentioned here."
what about php !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??😂😂
Still alive only because of WordPress and Laravel
​ @vishnusidharth9309  so?
Hello mosh where does PHP come in
In the thrash bin
Mosh can you do an AI course for beginners? Love you from the UK ❤❤❤
Mosh notifications? Im there 🤲
please make a complete roadmap on how to become a cyber security engineer!
Please do Javascript DOM Course 😂😂
do you want to learn mern stack development
"Hi Mosh! thank you for your useful content. Can you make one for blockchain software development, please?"
do you want to learn mern stack development
"I recently started building a website for my crochet amigurumi pattern business, and I find building blocks with a block editor really fun 😊. This video has given me a roadmap for learning more about web design 😁"
do you want to learn mern stack development
People who are saying AI will take the job. Take a look at job post now. They are hiring more than 2X web devs now. It's easier to say the hardest to do. You can only make a landing page of a website with unstructured design and unresponsive layout. And when it comes to user experience this will be ai experience 😂 because AI cant make all ur wishes comes true
A positive outlook on web dev job at last. ❤
Love you Mosh 🫶🏻🥰 Love From INDIA 🇮🇳
Embedded systems please
yes please! I want to know as well
"Honestly, backend recommendations should be Python when planning to work with AI, Java for various appliances, and JavaScript for actual web dev at the core."
Will JavaScript suffice throughout web development? Or do you need to learn an extra language?
​ @mridulbarman4114 U also have to learn their labraries or framework for example JavaScript... framework node.js
"Thanks Mosh for this great video! I'm currently diving deep into your Python Mastery course and loving the Classes module. What would you recommend learning next to build on this foundation? Any Python learning tips would be awesome!  I'd love to see a Python Mastery course update with the latest Python features. It would be incredibly valuable for students like me. Keep up the amazing work!"""
"The market for web development is incredibly bad. Every month you have a new bunch of web dev grads from bootcamps, and a lot of the startups simply use website builders instead. Very low demand, and way too much supply."
"Spot on. Entrepreneurs and employees have plenty of options and tools with website builders, plugins, low code and no code solutions to create just about anything required. Now with AI, any extras that require coding solutions can be done on-demand for any language. There's still a learning curve but you can accomplish way more in much less time than starting from scratch. Going through a year of courses is like taking math courses then solving equations by hand when a calculator is right there. Developers providing the most value to the market are building SAS, intuitive low-code frameworks and prebuilt plugins that make it easy for businesses to deploy working web apps fast.  WordPress alone saves businesses billions with its massive repository of plugins and themes. Use its API and you can build anything these other frameworks can with better tested more stable code in a fraction of the time."
Is PHP a good choice for the back end?
"Yes, I've been told it still does."
Yes it is
"0:45 this is so true. I remember when I started learning web dev, I started with html and css but when it came time to learn JavaScript I was stuck and that led me to think web dev was hard for a long time.Until I was started learning more back end languages that I started getting the hang of it."
"Much love from 🇹🇿. Glad to listen the frontend roadmap. Kudos to 4M followers including me, such a goodone Mosh. God bless you and see you at the top."
Hi Mosh can you pls teach spring boot framework it's your student humble request
Mosh the best man in the world I do have a big  love and respect for you
1 like 1 pushup
Good luck getting a job in this market off a tutorial 😅😅😅
Second seat🎉😂
"Ha, first seat❤"
😅😂😂😂

Please make a video on FYP project ideas
Thank you my best Tutor
Spring boot
Magics! You Tutorials are just on another level!
Thank you Mosh  I need a devops Roadmap
Is web development still relevant in AI era 🤔
"AI is never the problem. The problem is that the amount of junior web developers is insanely high, and the market keeps leaning towards website builders. In other words, demand is increasingly lower, while supply is getting higher."
"He forgot to mention that getting a job as a web developer right now is going to be nearly impossible for someone without any professional experience, and extremely difficult for people with many years of experience even. The tech job market is abysmal."
So what should we do instead to get a job?
" @ZekiAydnl-cx1cq  pick a different career I guess, its rough out there right now"
​ @alex-cf4dy like in the US ?
 @baskarannambiar5806  yes
"Thank you, Mosh. What are your thoughts on Laravel?"
PHP?
"""Mosh is my ideal in the tech world. 🌟 He's an inspiration and a role model in technology for me."""
Thankyou sir
"Hey, I m Professional in Web development but I m watching this!"

GOAT IS BACK
Mosh sir lots of love from India
I mosh can you please make a video of what kind of projects can we do for fresher or intern and portfolio and  exemple of resumes  Thanks
I enjoy backend more but dont see jr jobs. Frontend you must master css responsive design and so many css framrworks  backend is thst jobs are devided by each language. Python django is fun but lack of jobs. I see java pop up more.
🤩
"Thanks, Mosh😍, for this great video! I'm currently diving deep into your Python Mastery course and loving the Classes module. What would you recommend learning next to build on this? Any pro tips for accelerating my Python journey?  A revamped Python Mastery course with the latest Python version would be incredible! It would be a game-changer for learners like me. Keep up the amazing work!"
do not only create roadmap . do make tutorials as well mosh😻
"Thanks for the videos man! One quick question though, assming one starts with backend and learns all the stuff you mentionned here, how much faster will learning the frontend part become?"
"Well.... You can learn JavaScript much faster then since you've already done hardcore programming before. Most beginners starting with frontend, find JavaScript challenging. Overall, the solid foundation you build when learning backend development transfers when learning frontend development and I'd say it should roughly help you go 30-40% faster."
"i knew Python and Django, and switched to Javascript and React. They are really 2 different worlds. The only thing you dont need to learn twice is looping, data structures, types (dictionnary strings numbers etc). But yeah, 2 different purposes and 2 different worlds. Even in the core concepts, working with Dates libraries in Python or in Javascript are 2 different approaches"
Web development is dead
Why?
I learned python basics now learning js did i did a mistake?
"Don't just randomly learn languages. First, decide what kind of tech job you want to pursue, then learn the languages for that job only. That's what my roadmap videos are for."
"Mosh, how do I know if I am ready to work remotely with foreign countries in the field of front-end or after learning back-end as a full stack developer?"
You are like Johnny sins😊
Your video quality and animation is great 😊

Mosh heroku is not free please help me
talk data analysis roadmap
"Hei Mosh, Need blockchain development roadmap."
Hello mosh.Will Ai replace web development jobs in the future or in the next 10-15 years
is their any difference between Web development and Software development?
"Web development only depends on html css javascript and other languages,but software development depends on several languages"
"As a person who loves Java and not much of CSS 😂, I thought to myself that I'll look into bootstrap -> git -> springboot -> postgresql since I'm already familiar with basics of html, css and javascript."
"Can you post full course video about ""Anthropic AI Model - Claude 3.5 sonnet"" web version and API and fine tune and use case and applications.. complete Claude 3.5 sonnet course for developers..."
"truly speaking this guide isnt accurate because 2 months of studying programming and problem solving isnt enough except if you're already have a knowledge of other programming language but for complete beginner trust me for all of you its not  easy as you might think because at first learning to setup code environment and encountering the syntax at first setup is very confusing especially if you have no idea what to do and what is the use of that shit even on that day i watch a lot of videos for something like how it works..how to do it but still its very  confusing specially on syntax but when the time goes on i slowly get comfortable writing some basic code but the thing is that debugging, writing clean code, and testing are the most barrier of all when it comes to software development..so far after learning for about 4 years of coding and i find web development much easier to develop..for all of you guys  hoping to learn fast as 2 months only as a complete beginner even you have a bootcamp and courses to guide you it makes you a bad developer because yourself didnt have discover your own way to develop software much better and much faster for me as a self taugh i confidently saying that i can develop website a full complex functional website by myself only because i discover my own skill on how to manage, deploy, write code much faster, embracing ai and specially to handle your project..so learning as a self taugh is not only worth but it makes your developing a lot easier"
Please regcomman the resource for these roadmap
How to learn everything  Any resources  Please tell me
"I think, we should start web development from front end."
#codewithfurqan 🔥🔥
Pls do a game developer roadmap 🙏🙏🙏
Can you expanciate on the Automated Testing part.
Hey mosh are you going to do an update for the java course?
"Hey Mosh , can you please a video on software engineer roadmap for 2024.. please make it ..."
But sir how can I learn from you
Why not Kotlin?
"Hey Man , really nice video ! I was wondering if I could help you with more Quality Editing in your videos and also make a highly engaging Thumbnail and also help you with the overall youtube strategy and growth ! Pls let me know what do you think ?"
We need a road map for data engineer
"Hey everyone, does anyone know where I can find more PDF materials from Mosh? That would be super helpful."
"thank you mosh,"
"Mosh joon, isn't it a time to publish Rust series based on real projects?! We need such a thing. Writing a kernel driver based on Rust would be amazing course from you Mosh joon ❤❤"
"Hi,  This video is really very useful for understanding the steps to become a developer, but what do you think about test engineers? People specialized solely in quality, automation testing.  Many testers have or need to have a good foundation in coding   Do you think you'll talk about this category in the future as well?  Thank 😊"

Making AI agents with Python is a great skill to pick up. Media like SmythOS can keep time by streamlining complex workflows. What are your famous AI projects to work on
Am gonna use ChatGPT 😂😂😂 can’t waste time with all this
It's easier to say the hardest to do. You can only make a landing page of a website with unstructured design and unresponsive layout. And when it comes to user experience this will be ai experience 😂 because AI cant make all ur wishes comes true
What about node.js and deployment?

do you want to learn mern stack development
Specialization is the main thing in tech field!
"This video is really worth watching and exceptional explanation. He explained the reality of web development very systematically. Thanks for the video.  I am 2 year experienced developer. I am good at Javascript and Python. I worked on Node.js, MongoDB for 1.5 years. Worked for 6 months in the same company on wordpress for designing static websites. I have got familiar with css concepts like flexbox and grid. Did not work on HTML, CSS.  Based on your experience and research please suggest me which would be the best option for me? 1) backend 2) front-end 3) full stack  Based on the job search and your experience please guide me. This video was excellent. I want to know from you."
"Thank you, Mosh. I was apparently missing to learn Data structure and Design pattern. I will definitely give it a try."
hello and hope you are well I have a general question  without computer science bachelor degree could we take a job as a full stack web developer?  please answer me

Can the same be followed for freelancing?
"When you show the work opportunity for React’s programmer, which app were you using?"

Thank you for the valuable information!
Young Patricia Moore Jeffrey Clark Gary
Man I changed my mind
A lot of respect for this roadmap. Now I just hope that the roadmap is the right one to follow.
But everyone should learn front end development first.  You misguided people. No one hire a fresh back end developer .
to master html and css takes like a year not 2 to 3 weeks
"Попробовал, всё работает, спасибо!"
🎉 Your lecturing pattern is of excellent l love it
I want to become to become a software engineer but I don't know where to start. can you please help me?
Really interesting 👍
could i have the road map with your free courses for c#
"@programmingwithmosh In your video, you mentioned that the course can be completed in a 2, 3 or few month to learn the perticular technology. I would like to understand what you mean by 'months.' How many hours per day should I dedicate to complete the course within that time frame?"
"Love from India bro 👋😁, i watch your videos in hindi language."
Frontend vikas backed vikas aur full stack vikas 😂
"Hello Chief , please i want have to skills to create this video presentation."
"Its better  as a youtuber than programmer nowadays haha, go switch"
