Very low demand, and way too much supply.","2","@AhmedHuzain","false","false","false","false","","false",""
"2 months ago (edited)","Spot on. Entrepreneurs and employees have plenty of options and tools with website builders, plugins, low code and no code solutions to create just about anything required. Now with AI, any extras that require coding solutions can be done on-demand for any language. There's still a learning curve but you can accomplish way more in much less time than starting from scratch. Going through a year of courses is like taking math courses then solving equations by hand when a calculator is right there. Developers providing the most value to the market are building SAS, intuitive low-code frameworks and prebuilt plugins that make it easy for businesses to deploy working web apps fast.  WordPress alone saves businesses billions with its massive repository of plugins and themes. Use its API and you can build anything these other frameworks can with better tested more stable code in a fraction of the time.","1","@stinger0772","true","false","false","false","","false",""

"2 months ago","Well.... You can learn JavaScript much faster then since you've already done hardcore programming before. Most beginners starting with frontend, find JavaScript challenging. Overall, the solid foundation you build when learning backend development transfers when learning frontend development and I'd say it should roughly help you go 30-40% faster.","1","@programmingwithmosh","true","false","false","false","","false",""

"2 months ago","truly speaking this guide isnt accurate because 2 months of studying programming and problem solving isnt enough except if you're already have a knowledge of other programming language but for complete beginner trust me for all of you its not  easy as you might think because at first learning to setup code environment and encountering the syntax at first setup is very confusing especially if you have no idea what to do and what is the use of that shit even on that day i watch a lot of videos for something like how it works..how to do it but still its very  confusing specially on syntax but when the time goes on i slowly get comfortable writing some basic code but the thing is that debugging, writing clean code, and testing are the most barrier of all when it comes to software development..so far after learning for about 4 years of coding and i find web development much easier to develop..for all of you guys  hoping to learn fast as 2 months only as a complete beginner even you have a bootcamp and courses to guide you it makes you a bad developer because yourself didnt have discover your own way to develop software much better and much faster for me as a self taugh i confidently saying that i can develop website a full complex functional website by myself only because i discover my own skill on how to manage, deploy, write code much faster, embracing ai and specially to handle your project..so learning as a self taugh is not only worth but it makes your developing a lot easier","0","@pureprogrammingph","false","false","false","false","","false",""
