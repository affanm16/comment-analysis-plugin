Second, getting familiar with a public cloud is not mentioned here, which is also an essential skill in many jobs.   The specifics often depends on the role, and the job expectations vary widely, some focusing more on the Data Science side, and other roles like ML Engineer focus somewhat more on data engineering and product building side.
